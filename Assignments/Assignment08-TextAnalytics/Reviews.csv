0	DrBob1	1	Probably works well, but app a problem	"Product well reviewed, but app ""permission details"" (you always read those before downloading, don't you?) are ridiculous. It demands permission to go through, change or delete any or all accounts on my phone, and permission to take over control of my camera and microphone, whether I'm using the app or not, in addition to the other more common permissions (like location). Why does Google need my identity and accounts info, and free use of my camera and microphone, to send images from my computer to my TV? This troubles me, and I took the device back without ever hooking it up. There are other options with more respect for a user's privacy."
1	nPrime2000	5	Affordable device with surprising utility	"Before I get started, this will not replace a Roku, Amazon Stick, or any other full featured streaming device. Nor is it meant to. It will, however, provide a surprising amount of function and utility if you use it as a complementary device. I plugged it into my surround sound system via HDMI, and from here I can: stream music from my phone (effectively turning my system into a wireless speaker system better than any bluetooth speaker), stream content from my laptop and chrome book (replacing the need for a HDMI cable and adaptpr), view pictures and video from my phone or tablet (both from my private library and any number of streaming services). 

Again, this won't replace say a Roku. Lack of a dedicated remote control and native apps, as well as the required ""casting device"" keep it out of the realm of ""similar"" devices. However, it's hard to argue with the cost ($35 - I picked mine up for $30) and the value it provides. Just know what you're getting in to!"
2	Brij	5	Excellent Upgrade	I have an old Chromecast one and it works fine but somehow if i cast through my browser i need to downgrade to 480p. The new Chromecast addresses these problems. It streams smoothly with HD quality. It can also play 4k movies (tested with youtube). Additionally they included surround sound that was missing in the previous version. Overall excellent purchase.
3	adam	5	Its Amazing	If you are in question about this product, then look no farther. This thing is twice as fast as the first Chromecast. And its the cheapest video streaming device out! Seriously, at 35 dollars, you will not be disappointed. It should be your first choice just because its so cheap.
4	Brad	5	Great little device	"Purchased this for my bedroom as I don't have a cable converter in there and sometimes like to watch a little tv in bed. My son stole it. They don't have cable at his mom's house so with this, a variety of apps and my cable info, he's able to watch some of the programs he enjoys. I've since replaced this with another. My daughter stole that one. I only have one other kid so, maybe if I buy two more, I'll get to keep one. 
BTW, you don't have to have the Chromecast app to use this. Pretty much anything compatible automatically displays the cast symbol and will find your device as long as it and the phone are on the same wifi network. My son also found a work around for unsupported video apps. For this trick, you do need the Chromecast app. Use the apps mirror feature to cast your phones screen to your television, then play your video. Happy casting"
5	biglar2200	5	This is the best.	It took about 5 minutes to set this up. It works perfect with great video, and sound quality. I love it. Please note that you do need to power this with USB power supply, but that s included.
6	Melhere	5	Picks up weak signal	My old Chromecast wouldn't pick up the weak signal in my bedroom. This version picked it up right away and I haven't had any trouble with buffering while watching.
7	Ryan	5	Impressed. Google Chromecast is very fun.	"This new 2015 model of Google Chromecast is awesome. It's much smaller than it looks in all of the images and advertising. It's a small circle with an HDMI cable (male) coming out of one end and a Micro USB power receptacle (female) on the other end. It's funny looking, but it works very well. There is also an EZ factory reset button on the side of the circle. And of course, a Micro USB power adapter is included.

It was very easy to setup, and I love the beautiful screen savers. Casting from my laptop with Chrome and my Android phone is very easy and seamless. You can use your Apple devices to cast to Chromecast as well. The video and audio quality in HD are great. I love it!

IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you have a good fast WiFi router at the location where you plan to use the Chromecast. If you want to watch video in 720p and 1080p, you will need the capability to stream high amounts of data (from the router to the Chromecast). Most people's routers should be fine, but I'm just letting you know!"
8	One4all	5	Great Decision for PLEX users	"I own both the original Chromecast and the 2015 model. The reason why I went ahead and purchased the 2015 model was not for its features but the ability to connect to my AC router and stream my HD quality videos from my PLEX media server to my Television FLAWLESSLY.

If you are like me and have your own media database, I highly recommend it. I am an android/s6 user and have had 0 problems. With my prior Chromecast I was unable to play some of my videos and had to lower the resolution with 720p at times. PROBLEM NO MOREEE!!!"
9	joeschmo00123	5	very good	Great product just picked it up in store today. Hooked up to ac wifi seems much faster. One reason for writing this review others have stated you must use power adapter which is false. The instructions state to plug into wall adapter however there is also fine print that states it may be used with usb power from tv too. So to those saying its requried please read instructions in full. Also im ising it now no power brick just usb from tv.
10	JASE33	5	Better than before, But not Different	I had the original chromecast but when I moved I had so much 2.4Ghz interference that it was unusable. Now that this new one works with 5Ghz WiFi I am back to streaming again.
11	JesusRoar	5	Upgrade to CPU and WiFi	"The new CPU model in the Chromecast (2015) can be found here:
http://www.marvell.com/company/news/pressDetail.do?releaseID=7116

I purchased it recently and wanted to try it because on the old chromecast whenever my Ethernet throughput would pass 35Mbps it would begin stuttering a lot.

After trying the new Chromecast I am very impressed. There was one scene from a blu-ray rip where the Ethernet throughput would go as high as 95Mbps and there wasn't a single stutter at all. Just that alone makes this purchase worth it for me as I don't have to choose anything less than original quality now on my plex media server.

If you use anything like Plex and are a videophile and/or audiophile as you love streaming high bitrate content then I strongly recommend to upgrade to this model if you have the older chromecast.

I did these tests with the Ethernet adapter on both products."
12	socalguy	4	Chromecast is an awesome product	"This small device connected to the TV is in constant use in our home. We cut the cord and use multiple streaming services now (still save money each month and have more content). The Chromecast makes watching content form all sorts of apps very easy. 

Pros:
The setup was quick and painless. (except minor issue see cons)
The quality of video and sound is great. 
Reduces clutter as it is tiny and hidden behind the TV

Cons:
Did not connect on 5ghz until I made changes to my wifi router settings (has to be 20hz not 40hz channel width)
Hotel Network connection (or others were a web browser is required) is not possible. Google needs to create some kind of basic browser to allow the validation.

Note - make sure you understand this device is not stand alone like a Roku or Fire TV it requires a smart phone, tablet, or computer to ""Cast"" to it."
13	Gator417	5	Best $35 I ever spent!	"More powerful processor, faster and better wireless connection make this device even better than the awesome original. Plug it in, follow the 2 minute ""on screen"" instructions, and you are on to a world of streaming. Works with my laptop, phone, tablet, and Chromebook. Best Buy has them in the store too."
14	Wardawg31	4	Better than a poke in the eye	"Pros: I can cast shows from YouTube, Netflix and others and that is nice. I used the USB plug on my TV so I did not need to use the power supply. I am planning on casting a fireplace scene this Christmas. Cool.

Cons: Tends to get a bit warm. Using the USB as power leaves it running all the time regardless if I am using it or not. It needs to have a power off feature. 

Overall, it is worth the money if you have a $35 burning a hole in your pocket. So, good and better than a poke in the eye."
15	RayJ	5	Fantastic Device	I own the original chromecast device. Recently heard about the new device and did my research. I was excited to see that the new chromecasts were way better than the original ones with picking up the wifi signal, and reducing buffering. I can gladly say that since I've owned my new device, it has not disappointed. I can now watch movies in peace without pausing every few seconds to buffer. Fantastic purchase. No regrets!!!
16	Dan0h48	5	A great sequel to a great product	I loved all of my original chromecasts however I did think the wifi was a little slow. I no longer have that issue with the new model. I also, as always, received some great offers including a free movie rental with this purchase. I find it hard to even consider any other streaming device when this covers it all so well for only $35. I personally LOVE using my phone as a remote for it.
17	Gwman2001	5	Works great with new router speeds	Original model couldn't recognize the different channels on our new Comcast router. Only the slowest one. Now I can stream with full speed potential. No more buffering.
18	Gutch325	4	Good Upgrade	I have used the original Chromecast for a few months now and really liked it. This new Chromecast is great. Seems to have a better wireless signal strength and is much easier to use. Recommended.
19	Chris	3	Better Design but Plagued by Restart Issues	"I have 2 of the first generation models and I love them. I bought one of these second gens for a new TV and at first I loved everything about this new version.

I love the new look, I think it's much more appealing to look at. The flexible wire between the HDMI out and the Chromecast body also feels much more stable than the original, which I always feel is one clumsy mistake away from being destroyed.

On plugging the Chromecast in it worked well. Setup was quicker than I remember and it required little effort from plug in to watching Netflix. About a month later, though, I started to notice the Chromecast would shut off and restart while watching anything on it. I tried different apps, I tried different power sources, I even tried power cycling it. Nothing worked. What did work was switching to one of my first generation models.

It doesn't look like this is a issue that's rampant across these models because I couldn't find much information online, but it's still a bad experience for me. Because of this, I could not recommend this model to a friend."
20	TimBo	5	Better than original	This chrome cast is way better than the original. Chrome casting videos and music happens a lot faster and smoother. I would upgrade to this if you stil have the older one.
21	StevenR	4	Awesome product to make your old tv in to smart tv	"I absolutely love the chrome stick.
I have a Roku TV in our bedroom and a older 70' Plasma TV in our living room. I missed not being able to stream to our Plasma and having to use cables and adapters to connect laptop, iPad, iPhone, ...but the TV still works perfect so no need to buy a new one yet. So after some research I decided to get the Chromecast. Now with one click i mirror any screen i want.
It should get a 3/4 of a star more but that was sadly not possible. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it has one little negative point for me. The product is designed as a product on the go. I understand that it if it is an new network you have to connect the stick to the new network. But you have to re input your network every time if you go to an other network. It would be nice if it had some sort of memory to store previous networks that you have connected with before. Like a cellphone has with the WiFi points it has bin connected with. It may not be possible inside the stick but maybe in the Chromecast App. Lets hope for one of the software updates.
But next to that, perfect product. Comes with USB cable and power adapter. I love it. For 35$ its a no brainer!!!"
22	xeke	5	Very versatile	"I would really give it 4.5 because nothing is perfect. But it does some surprisingly handy things that I did not expect. I like my Roku for different reasons and I like having both, but the Chromecast lets me access and watch all sorts of web-based content that can't be done with the Roku stick or my Samsung Smart TV alone. But the most innovative use was to turn my 42"" screen TV into a teleprompter for a youtube video project. I was able to open the google word doc script on my Chromebook and broadcast it to the TV screen via the Chromecast. It made my day. Saved me hours of memorization or posterboard teleprompts. This is not a feature for everybody but it does show the Chromecast's versatility."
23	NYY0420A	5	Easy Installation! Portable and Fast.	I currently have a 802.11AC wireless router and my decision came down to buying an Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast since they both support wireless AC. I chose the Chromecast based on the price and supposed solid integrated software build. I am pleased to say that the Google Chromecast is simply great. It was a breeze installing it and I love how it remains hidden behind my TV while plugged in via USB. Being plugged in via USB is great since the Chromecast will only be on when the TV is on as well, saves energy. It does require more work to use since there is no remote and you have to use your smartphone, tablet or computer to initiate the content stream. I have gotten used to it and everything has been streamed seamlessly. I have ZERO disconnections so far. There are no ADS or commercials that Google pushes onto you; it is just straight to the content. I am a happy customer!
24	Tomscabin	4	Good for introductory SmartTV Users	"The price is right!

Can be used with a SmartTV or a non-SmartTV.

Very portable. Great for multiple TV users or on the go. You do not have to buy 2,3,4+ Chromecasts. You just need one HDMI port IN on your TV. If you have a USB power source on your TV, great! Otherwise, this can get powered through AC.

Best feature by far is the ""Share My Screen"". Can be used with your device to show whatever is on your screen. Not just apps that integrate with Chromecast.

Easy setup, but the only thing I found annoying was I had to reboot everything (internet and TV) during setup to get all my Chromecast features to work which was not part of the directions, but is on TECH Support. I would recommend toggling every power source after setup to use as a precaution."
25	InsomniacShopaholic	4	Worth the Upgrade	"I didn't buy the original Chromecast because of its small RAM, only wifi 2.4ghz, and streaming limitations to 720p at 60fps or 1080p at 30fps. Also at the time app compatibility was limited.

This new model exceeded my expectations. The 5ghz band is much faster and doesn't cause Bluetooth interference. The backgrounds are very customizable and the link with Google+ allows lots of cool info and pics from other sources.

From my very slow laptop mirroring of the chrome browser and casting of music and video still was very clear.

From my galaxy S5 I streamed a full HD movie (the free rental with purchase) with good quality and no pausing or A/V lag.

I believe there is the option to have the Chromecast output 2 channel compressed audio in a multichannel format but I wish you could directly stream lossless audio or multichannel from your own media library. MP3 and M4A files streamed fine but surround was incompatible and 48khz 24bit 2 channel wav files came out distorted.

Overall the new Chromecast is pretty great. My only complaint is not being able to cast your own lossless audio for playback."
26	D790	5	Simply amazing!	The new Chromecast is simply amazing. It improves on everything it needed to and is now and more reliable in rooms furthest from my router.
27	123456789	1	Too many glitches	Don't waste your money, too many glitches. Also it's losing connection every minute. Very disappointed
28	rachiti	1	If you don't mind rebooting it ALL the time...	"When I purchased the original Chromecast a couple of years ago, it was fantastic. One click ""threw"" my laptop screen onto the TV no trouble. After a few months the software got less responsive but was otherwise OK. Then the power supply failed, so we bought a Chromecast II. 

Due to ""upgrades"" to the Chromecast software, it no longer single click casts for Facebook (it's 3 steps now) & takes FOREVER to cast from Chrome. Secondly, it needs to be rebooted MULTIPLE times a day as it will freeze and just stop allowing anything to cast to it. We've actually plugged it into a remote on/off switch because it hangs up THAT often. Finally, after just a few month's use, the power supply on this Chromecast II also failed. 

It serves a purpose, but it's junk both on the component level & the software. It needs a complete overhaul to make it decent again."
29	salah	5	very good	I was looking for a way to cast my Netlfix and HBO Go apps onto my VIZIO (no smart feature) and this was the answer to my prayers. It's so easy to set up - I can use my iPhone or my iPad. Very affordable as well. Keep in mind there's no remote - you will be asked to download the App to your smartphone or tablet and you control it (fast forward, pause, rewind etc.) from your device. The clarity is perfect and no delay or buffering. If your TV has an extra USB slot - that's perfect. since it's powered that way. If not, it comes with a regular plug so make sure you have the capacity to keep it powered. My TV only has one so I bought a USB port that can connect multiple USB devices. Lastly, there are a ton of apps that are supported by Chrome cast - make sure the ones you want are on there before you buy. They are all listed on their web site. Plug in and enjoy!
30	nedron	4	Cutting the cord	Purchased this to enable me to cut the Xfinity cord. It's tough not just turning on the TV and not thinking about what to watch. Chromecast requires a decision on which app to open and which show to watch. Most apps work great, Hulu, Netflix, FX. Occasionally they glitch, but I'd give them 99% satisfaction. The one that gives the most trouble is live-streaming on NBCSports. Casting from Chrome browser is the least desirable. Overall, well worth the savings from paying the cable company.. Oh, plus it will help to have a friend with cable that will allow you to use their credentials to get more channels.
31	EKLC	4	Perfectly Functional	"I bought the Chromecast in order to do one and only one thing - to stream media from my phone to a projector.

....It works as advertised, and the only minor complaint that I have is that there is no method to turn the device off - you either leave it on, or need to physically unplug the USB power supply."
32	MovieCollector	1	Not excited.	I have tried to link my cell phone to this so I could cast from the phone and so far I haven't been able to get it to work. Need to go through the online trouble shooting guide from Chromecast yet to be sure that I'm not the problem. I'm disappointed. The instructions that came with this are very straight forward but don't help if something doesn't work as presented.
33	BenSalem	4	Great but 5GHz doesn't work	Just like my old chromecast. I bought this just because it had the 5GHz support because a 2.4GHz band dies when using the microwave. Sadly the 5GHz network wont connect properly.
34	Verte	5	Faster Chromecast	At first I thought I didn't need to upgrade from the Chromecast v1 but the 5ghz was too tempting. I live in an apartment and there's so many wifi waves flying around. So far the upgrade has been loading my casts faster with no stalls ever since I upgraded on day 1. Very happy with the upgrade.
35	texstar112	4	Better than initial release	I can notice a difference now in buffering and quality of stream now due to the enhanced electronics and bigger accessory. You can power this unit via a usb port on your TV. No need to use the adapter.
36	KyThomas	5	I like it!	Purchased this so we could try some streaming apps. Setup was easy linking our TV and Android tablet. Some apps work better than others, but that will probably improve over time. And we're still exploring. If you don't have a smart TV and don't have a need/want for cable, this is a good option.
37	Dondo	1	Clunky interface	Difficult to navigate and it does not support Amazon Prime
38	Disappointed	1	This Thing does not play nice with Sling.	Had high hopes going in but this is much to frustrating to keep. We will be returning it for something that is dependable with Sling. Too many error interrupts and picture quality degradations.
39	TheDude	5	Easy to Install	The ChromeCast was easy to install and setup. I am using the USB port on the TV to power it so I did not require a plug in spot. The only hard thing about setting it up and using it is trying to decide what to cast to it from my pc and phone. It is a great deal for the price.
40	SamLee	4	I still like the 1st gen more	"I got this to replace the 1st generation Chrome Cast I gave to my parents this summer. I thought the 2nd generation will be better in all ways. The design is improved and looks more like Google logo. The power consumption seems to be better (I used to run it from USB power bank some times) but there is a major change I noticed. The buffering isn't that good as in the 1st gen. So I looked for the specs online and I found out that Google took most of the buffering memory out, This would work really fine if your internet is fast enough. for slow internet (even streaming locally) it would take forever buffering-playing simultaneously... Thing I didn't have with the old Chrome Cast.
Other than that, the same like the 1st gen. The Google Chrome Cast is a great device to add to your TV."
41	dgw062400	1	You get what you pay for!	"Pro: 
1. Price (the only reason I gave it a try)
2. Wireless to devices

Con: 
1. Very difficult to connect at a hotel if no splash page. If there is a splash page, no connectivity period! Took 2 hours with tech support for hotel to get connectivity with no splash page.
2. Limited on what can be ""cast"" without mirroring.
3. Must have Wifi.

Took this back and traded it in for an adapter. Adapter works better and allows you to run all apps. I would not recommend this product.

Just remember, you get what you pay for!"
42	d666	1	Great when it works!	I bought 2 chromecasts that worked for a while - then some days it says device missing, my workaround was to use my phone but then that couldn't find the devices. If been through all the help forums and I am sick of wasting my time trying everything on this junk
43	Wendie	5	Awesome Device	I needed something that would allow me to play music from my phone on my Tv. The associate suggested Chromecast, which I was not familiar with. I absolutely love this device. It does much more than I was looking for and basically turns my Tv into a smart Tv. Great product...thanks for the suggestion!
44	Bonez	5	Good Streaming Solution	I bought this to stream contents from my laptop to my television and it works just fine.
45	Dan1	5	Great Product	Very simple to setup and use. Was easily able to stream from many apps.
46	Sambit	5	Good product	Good to cast from laptop to TV and still can continue to work.
47	Bassnote	5	Easy setup, Easy to use	"I wanted a device that would display the Internet on my Television that didn't have all the restrictions I see with some competing devices out there. Chromecast is just that device for me. Basically it displays (casts) everything my Tablet or Smartphone has displayed on its screen. Not only does it cast (displays) the Internet shows I was wanting but its casts everything, picture taken, InstaGram, YouTube!
I am very happy with my chromecast, if it broke today, I would run out and buy another one for tonight!"
48	Anopenendedsky1	5	Great Device!	Because of this wonderful little device, I no longer have any use for cable! I can stream whatever I want to watch directly from my phone or tablet! Can't believe I waited so long to purchase!
49	DonC	4	Loads of fun	Super for streaming content, especially when using vendor apps through my cable subscription. Also the Google photo app gives the opportunity to enjoy pictures and personal video content on a big screen in HD
50	Mopo	1	Impossible	I bought this item as new during the black friday 2 x $50 offer. One of the devices was used, not new as advertised. I have been trying to return it by mail and it seems to be a task of titanic proportions for the customer care service team. After 15 acknowledgement emails I never received what I was asking for. As for the device, don't bother even trying if you have an iphone or ipad. The interaction with iOS is frustrating and many functions are lost when compared to android.
51	josephrs2012	5	This Google Chromecast Functions Well.	This Google Chromecast version is a great product and has great features. The product is comparable in overall usage and functionality, when compared to the previous Google Chromecast versions.
52	edwp	4	Works as intended	Easy way to get Netflix or HBO Go streaming to a TV that isn't smart or has apps; works from both a phone or computer. Did not have the old version so I can't really compare the two.
53	GeorgeB	5	My second one	I have a new smart TV but bought this for the chromcast features.
54	MSVP	1	Malfunction product	Not working properly. Can’t cast. Very disappointed.
55	roonytoon5	1	Works when it wants to	I'm not sure if it is the connection or what but it only works sometimes
56	Jianji	1	Hard to operate	Found it hard to use and had to return it. The connection was slow and dropped from time to time.
57	Google	1	Not so good	The connection kept breaking and shows would stop mid showing. It constantly rebooted itself. Not very good at all!
58	Walter	1	Hate this.	It streams video ok but only from a good Wi-Fi. It Will work if you hot spot from cell phone / tablet only if have a second device to stream from. Make sure your cell phone / tablet are compatible also.
59	Esha	1	Hurt My Feelings	It wouldn't connect with my android phone. Then it did, then disconnected several times. It kept disconnecting while I was watching the movie. I feel that the device is not android friendly.Totally killed the mood!
60	Dogbox	1	Too difficult to control.	Compared to a Roku this streaming device is very poor. It depends on other devices for control. I have a laptop, smartphone and google home assistant that have some ability to control it. I can't figure out how to get the audio working with any of them.
61	alextvantioch	1	garbage	this thing is very glichy and does not cast well at all
62	vbhatia9	1	One star bad service	My expectations were normal but still it didn't perform well, so many times the signal gets lost while streaming , sometimes it takes more time to find the device
63	Tuck	1	Unsatisfied	I purchased this item to stream Netflix, Youtube etc... The lag was so terrible that I was unable to watch a complete episode. I usually do not have any issues with lag but may have just been my internet provider experiencing problems.
64	danygandhi	1	Utter piece of junk	Plagued with reconnect me errors on both 2.4 and 5Ghz. My first gen chromecast has been working fine on the same router for almost 2 years.
65	Katy	5	Chrome cast	This product is great. I've used chrome cast since they have been made. Love it. Easy to use
66	Mackgeofries	5	Great	I've got a few of these now, and a bunch of the Chromecast Audio, and they're tremendous. Oddly, the backdrop feature is probably my favorite right now, which is like a slideshow of the pictures I take (and decide to include), so I have one for work, and one for personal. I have a smart TV, but end up using this the majority of the time. Kids (and adults) can lose remotes, but my phone, while it can be lost just as easily, is much less likely to be lost. Plus, with Google Photos having the cast ability, instead of crowding around a phone or computer and viewing pictures that maybe they shouldn't see... BAM! the ones I want to show them are right there on the TV for people to see.
67	Mike	5	great product	My daughter has used chromecast for netflix,etc for years, and that has been great when I visit her and we watch series & movies together. I only got a digital TV a very few years ago. I do not regularly use a smart phone, so I didn't think chromecast was for me. I hooked my laptop to the TV with an HDMI cable . Awkward to move around the laptop & use it. Awkward use the laptop while watching. Cable ends fail, and replacement cables were expensive, When I learned (again- from my daughter) that I could use my computer to control comcast; I bought it and switched over from the cables. Much better experience. I had a few glitches in connection at first, but the learning curve was steep & easy.
68	Dean	1	Difficult to set up initially.	Does not appear to be a very useful product. Has limited applications. Will try again when I have more time.
69	1984Lee	1	Not good	This products response from the phone to the t.v down to the loading was too slow. It reminded me of a dial up connection. Also the application that I thought I could stream to the device was not available. I returned the product after 10 days for a full refund.
70	BlckRse21	5	Awesome products	I can't say enough good things about this. It's great for parties or cuddling on the couch. I use my Chrome cast all the time and don't have any problems. The only thing that I'm running into is that thereally are individual apps that require payment before unlocking the casting option but that's nothing to do with the device or Chrome!
71	Heidi	5	Great for travel	I travel for work and this makes it so much nicer than having to watch hotel tv channels
72	ErzaScralet	5	Excellent device that allows me to enjoy ALL apps!	I love binge watching shows of all kinds, and my Smart TV (Sony X850C) has a lot of built in apps I use. One of my favorite genre is Anime, and unfortunately the Android TV OS does NOT have apps for Crunchyroll or Funimation, and the built in casting for the TV is sporadic when it recognizes my phone, and inconsistent when playing; losing sync between video and audio minutes in all the time. Luckily, the phone apps of Funimation and Crunchyroll have built in casting, and the Chromecast I bought here has great wifi antennas to keep a great connection. I am also on an Android device (Galaxy S7 and Nexus 5X), so the built in screen mirroring is great for watching videos from KissAnime's website on my TV without the clunky Opera Browser of my TV. If you're on Android especially, or even iOS and have apps that are not on your SMart TV or Smart Box platform, but have the casting option or you can screen mirror, I cannot recommend this enough!
73	marianoam	5	Why did I wait this long to buy it?	I've always used an Apple TV and I thought it was unbeatable. I wanted to try a Chromecast and I was really surprised. It's simple, fast (no lag) and it does what it promises.
74	BroBear75	1	Know what you are getting	I wanted to get Netflix, etc. & stream from already owned device. Service Rep in store advised this product. It didn't perform. Either he was wrong or product was inadequate. Returned product to store for refund.
75	1142ema	1	should be obvious why this isn't on amazon	won't stream and errors constantly. I would love to actually enjoy this, but apple tv is way better and doesn't require 100 BS apps to work poorly
76	gowang	5	simple and useful for everyone	in comparison to other products this one works well and i dont seem to have any complaints
77	jordans4790	5	A HUGE improvement from the first Chromecast	I loved it! It works beautifully on our TV! Casting is a lot better and the streaming quality is amazing!
78	segos	4	great device!	takes my regular tv to the next level! no need to pay for a more expensive tv just to get the smart feature!
79	SergioA	5	Great for online streaming	"We were hesitant of buying it as we thought we wouldn't really use it. As it turns out, we ended up using the unit everyday. Our Samsung 'Smart-TV' doesn't have all the apps we want to stream so we use the Chromecast for HBO Now, Youtube (the Gcast is better than the samsung app) and other random videos on the web. The only downside I see is if you want to use the tv screen as a presentation tool. We really don't need it for that, and we basically knew what we were getting upfront, so no stars deducted. The Gcast only works with Chrome (or with a Gcast extension on your browser), so unless your presentation is on Google Drive then you'll better look for another option. Same goes with pictures, videos or other content that you have on your device.
Setup is straight forward and easy. The device itself does heat up a bit if its used for a while."
80	Je10	1	Terrible	I had the first generation for my theater and I figured I should upgrade but I was disappointed when the screen kept going grey. It got to a point where I just replaced it with my original chromecast. Paid $35 for less than a month of the thing working.
81	Fantome	1	Works great, except when it doesn't	I was initially happy with the new Chromecast, but I've had to drop my rating of this product since it no longer maintains a connection to my network. When it works, it's great and faster than the original. The problem is that it does not stay connected to my network. It spends most of its time on the blue screen saying to the effect of attempting to reconnect. However, I see no evidence of a connection attempt on my access point, nor do any of my other devices have any trouble. I factory reset and reconfigured the unit three times before I gave up with it. Thankfully, it hasn't been too much money down the drain.
82	Memo	5	Great casting	I enjoy it. It does the job for when i don't want to watch movies on my phone.
83	Domingo	5	It is cheap and useful for entertainment	I use this device minimum for 60 minutes per day, specially when watching movies.
84	Nick2k	5	quick & inexpensive way to cast your videos	i own a few of the 1st generation chromecasts. they work great. this new 2nd gen is even better. flexible installation port-wise and runs faster than the 1st gen.
85	Loven	5	Extremely easy to setup and use.	Chromecast is legit! Casting content from apps such as Nextflix, Amazon, and Pandora is fantastic. Setup took less than three minutes; simply connect the device to a HDMI port, plug it in, and download the Chromecast app to complete the setup process. Additionally, casting does not drain my tablet battery. Great product for the price paid.
86	malvar15	4	I like it but I the older version is better	I like it but I the older version is better. The older one is better than this one, this one works only when its plugged in an outlet while the older version gives you an option to plug with an outlet or use the usb of the TV. I prefer the latter option because i don't have to deal with any cords.
87	SmokingGun	2	Not so good with apple	"I purchased Chromecast because I have a Samsung TV and wanted to cast content mostly from my laptop. However all the devices we have are apple and it turned out to be very difficult to cast anything form the devices without having to download extensions, plug-ins or extra apps. 

We tried it for a couple of weeks and decided it would be better to get apple TV. 

In the end I could no really say more about the functionality and quality of the product because we didn't use it for a long time but decided to write a review hoping to help people like me with mostly apple devices to have a better idea. It's probably a great product for samsung/android/chrome users and I understand that most of the limitations in apple products compatibility are by design but the lower score I give it is not because of flaws but to inform apple users of this issue with compatibility."
88	PJ723	1	I had no idea of this product's limitations	This only works on a fraction of the aps from an iPad or iPhone. The majority of the applications I wanted to use it for were non-compatible. Also, buffering between my device and the TV was an issue.
89	Stevo	4	Cool!	Well this product works fine in casting both my phone and Pad to our TV. To bad AmazonPrime isn't supported. Looking at dropping cable now!!
90	Frank	5	Fantastic and Easy to Use	You easily set this thing up through your browser or Chromecast app on your phone and bam the whole house can share instantly. It turns on the TV for you when you need it and you just have to set it when you want to watch something. Not only that, Youtube can queue videos for you and all the major apps are supported. Pandora when you're cooking and Netflix when you're bored. Its great.
91	jjkmn	4	Works fine	This is model is way better than the previous one. It has better wifi connectivity and streams better.
92	Nathan	5	Great device for casual viewing	"If you're like me, you usually pull out your phone to look up video or audio content that you want to watch. Dedicated apps like Hulu, Netflix, or podcast apps are much faster and more convenient than going to your computer or using your TV or set top box to try and load a dedicated app and then fight an on-screen keyboard without touch control to browse through and select a show.

But there's no denying how nice that TV you have is to watch.

With the Chromecast, you can have both. Instantly stream video from your phone or tablet to your TV and use your device as a remote. You can even stream web pages using Chrome on your PC. Whether you're watching the latest videos on Netflix or Hulu, enjoying the latest movie you bought from Google Play Movies, streaming online radio, or just sharing the latest cat video you found, Chromecast makes it simple. Plug it into your TV and the wall, then one tap on your phone shares the video. Couldn't be easier."
93	SquirrellyJoe	5	Increase your TV's IQ	Why spend more for a smart TV when you can build your own for $35? (Plus the cost of your dumb TV, but hey, you've already got one of those, right?) We took advantage of a bundle offer which paired a Chromecast with an RCA amplified antenna. All the money previously spent on cable TV is now applied directly to the booze budget.
94	antoniopaz	5	it works perfect	good product for its price, can do most of my streamings
95	lifewillbeok	5	amazing little device!	All you need to do is hook it up do your tv's HDMI outlet. Voila! You have a lot of apps and anything you can run in chrome streamed wirelessly from your mobile device or computer to your TV. It's very easy for me to display vacation photos and videos for my entire family to enjoy when they visit for the holidays.
96	jsanchez1040	5	Great	Works great can stream anything on my phone to the TV.
97	Bxraidernation	5	awesome streamer for tv	easy to use. just connect to tv and your home wifi.
98	4moretoys	4	Falls a little short of expectation	Could be operator error, but this item seems to have a mind of it's owns deciding when and what it will let you view. And it isn't always consistent. Sometimes you can cast whatever you want from your phone, tablet or computer. Again, could be me because AppleTV acts the same way. But the price is so low you have to at least try it.
99	Kidfirebird	5	Fast, Simple, and Easy	Great product super easy to set up. Works just as good as the previous model. I love how all my movie apps stream seamlessly to the device.
100	Barney	5	Minor improvements but still solid	This is my second Chromecast and it's pretty much the same as the older version but with stronger wifi. Also this one runs much cooler than the original (which was kinda hot but still works great). Both are plugged into the power outlet not USB port.
101	Tre3	5	Perfect and Affodable	The Chromecast is perfect for TVs to stream your online subscriptions. The only set back is that it does not support Amazon Streaming (Understandable). If you rely on Amazon Prime, then I would buy the Fire Stick or Roku.
102	enigma	3	Ok	Its okay, did not have all the features I was looking for. Went with the Apple TV instead.
103	Flyboy	1	Audio and Video Don't Sync	I was very excited to purchase this product so I could stream content from my Surface Pro 4. I had seen the reviews that said the audio and video are out of sync, but I figured it must be user error. It wasn't. I tried everything that Google suggested but nothing worked...the audio simply doesn't sync with the video. Normally, I trust Google blindly but, this time, I'm sorry to say that they let me down big time. This is a real problem that must be fixed. I returned the product for a full refund.
104	chichii	4	Sweet for the price!	Pretty much a done deal for the price you get. At the time of my purchase it was $25, and at that time I was ready to purchase the Roku. The inexpensive price what the main factor. It is a very responsive device. To access control, you are required to use a smartphone, tablet, or PC in which it would be an inconvenience to some. I use my smartphone, which is practically with me all the time, so it is not inconvenient for me to control the Chromecast. However, having its own physical remote would have made it awesome.
105	Bootyeater69	5	Better than the first version	Really like then new design the took on this chromecast. Really makes it stand out from the rest of the media streaming devices on the market
106	Glenn	5	Works Better then the first one	"This unit works great I love it the new unit is better looking and the magnet helps to conceal it

Great product.."
107	finn	5	Better than Fire	I have both Fire Tv and Chromecast. I love chromecast much better because it will cast pages and through google docs, you cast presentations.
108	Daku	5	Better than older version	Super responsive. Cast very quick. I am so happy to own it.
109	TXTECHSALES44	5	Great Upgrade	Much Faster than Original version!!!! Also includes streaming via Bluetooth not just WIFI connections!
110	Qbert	5	It's a chromecast	Seriously, only good things to say about Chromecast. Great product. Had old one. Basically same, only faster. Get one. So many elaborate reviews already, what can I say.
111	Rouny	5	Great device	I purchase the device because I had family coming for the Holidays and I didn't have cable. It was easy to install and everyone was able to catch there favorite shows and more.
112	Starbase134	5	Super smooth!	I have a roku and love it. I bought this for another TV in the living room. I have to say, I'm sad I did not buy it before. It's a cheap 35 bucks and you can stream all the big services. Also, when my buddies come over its nice they can cast with Android and iOS.
113	Star	5	Better than the old version !!	Haven't had any issues, clear and crispy. Easy to installed!!!
114	Blacksuperman305	5	Great google chrome cast for beginner	This is an great buy for an media steaming device for your tv. This product is an amazing device.
115	LilHellion	5	Chromecast at Last!	Why would anyone ever bother paying for cable again? All you need is an antenna to pick up local channels/networks so that you don't miss the news and what not. Not to mention you'd have access to prime time shows, though you wouldn't be able to record them for later. That one-time purchase combined with the one-time purchase of a Google ChromeCast, and your on your way to eliminating your cable bill. ChromeCast is compatible with many monthly TV/movie subscription services (i.e. Hulu, Netflix), which only cost around $8/mo and you get access to almost any show you'd want to see, both old and new. The ChromeCast does connect to your PC, tablet, and phone, via a WiFi connection, and the device you're streaming content from must be connected to that WiFi and ChromeCast to work. So keep your internet service with your provider for sure, and after you decide for yourself, you too will want to cancel your cable service that has been draining your wallet for years. Hope you like it as much as I do!
116	BobG	5	Easy setup and use	This was an excellent choice for me. The setup was easy and getting the unit to work with my Samsung Tablet was just as easy. I like the idea of using the TV screen for my viewing with the Chromecast. I also like the fact that I can pull from my video accounts like Netflix and use those as well. One neat feature is the screensaver. By leaving the Chromecast on display, google-plus shows photos shared from the internet, most are fabulous choices by google....a little music behind this display would make it perfect for white noise and distraction!
117	Papalopes	5	Great streaming	Very nice picture quality and comes with everything needed to start watching
118	NotaMaddenFan	5	Streams perfect	The setup was easy and it streams perfect. We have 2 of them.
119	Leon	5	Awesome upgrade from original!!	It is definitely a step above the original chromecast!! Easy to connect.... and can finally connect to my 5g!!!
120	Diego	5	Better.	It is way better, smaller and faster than the old model.
121	gsuslivz5	5	Product is great	It is everything we were looking for we purchased firestick and others and this is best
122	DuxburyDad	1	Caution if you are using Slingbox	"I already owned Chromecast 1 and Roku. Purchased Chromecast 2 for my Slingbox. Did not work! After running the Slingbox app for about 10 minutes the horizontal hold on the picture broke, picture reverted to top half of screen and diagonal lines on bottom half. I tried two TV's using Chromecast 1, Chromecast 2 and Roku. ONLY the Chromecast 2 failed 100% of the time, no failure on the others.
Google support was very nice but not very helpful. They were not interested in providing more than cursory help .
Chromecast 2 did work well on YouTube and streaming movie trailers."
123	drolla	5	Amazing Add on	This product is a great add on if you don't have a smart tv. download all cast as well and you can cast way more than what chormecast allows.
124	ProudCouchPotato	1	returned- bought a smart tv instead	"Purchased this Chromecast for use with small bedroom non-smart tv. Wanted to stream Netflix, Hulu, etc. After dl-ing the app and allowing all the extra permissions this app requires, this device would not recognize or connect with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. Then tried again to make this work with my phone. Spent MORE time allowing the phone app to have all the invasive location & ad permissions- as well as access to my email & texts (??!!), and the Chromecast still.would.not.connect.
The only ""tech help"" available is the standard Google faq page.
I am fairly tech-savvy, but this was silly. A $30 device should not be so frustrating to troubleshoot.
It was easier to return it. I bought a new HD smart tv instead. FYI- less invasive permissions required for the smart tv ;)"
125	GenuineBuyer	5	Works	The only reason why i bought this is because my old model chromecast never really worked and google refused to honor their warranty
126	Libby	3	Good	This would be so much better if it could cast Amazon prime
127	cerebrodemono	2	Not user friendly at all	Apparently, Google stopped the ability to stream directly from the phone using it's data plan, so you must use a wifi modem/router and a device such as a phone or tablet to use it. Also, I was able to get it connected and communicating via wifi just once after initial set up, then the next time, it wouldn't recognize my device, thus not allow me to connect. Troubleshooting for this issue ate up too much of my time, so I figured it just isn't worth it. Bummer! I'm returning it.
128	Jeff	1	Junk	Junk, everything on the device requires a subscription. Otherwise you get commercials, an advertising saying if you don't want to see these commercials then subscribe. Duh!
129	Diterex	5	Easy	We use my Android and iPhone to cast with no problem. Super easy to setup.
130	hohop	5	A Xmas gift for me	I love the google chrome it’s so cool with google home voice control operation soooo easy
131	Prakamo	4	Easy to use, awesome streaming, value for $	"Great product!
This is the perfect product if you do not want to pay for cable tv. All you need is some sort of subscription to things such as Netflix, Hulu, or DirecTV.

All you got to do is turn your TV on, open the app and select the cast button. Currently Chromecast casts from your phone or iPad if you have Netflix, Hulu, etc. downloaded."
132	Euler	5	An easy way to stream media to your TV	With this item you can stream music and video to your TV. Installation is easy and takes almost no time.
133	JFish	5	Great product!	Love it. Works great for streaming! Great for sports and movies.
134	JimmyJack	2	POOR PERFORMANCE	Chromecast is easy to set up and use. There is not remote so you must use a smartphone which is a downside. The performance is terrible- pixilated screen, contact buffering etc. The Roku Premier is a far better interface if you are using a service like Sling.
135	effingc	2	nothing to wright home about	didnt work how i wanted it to. it wont work off a hotspot while i travel
136	drb1	2	Terrible	So bad I threw it out. Images were scrambled on the top of the screen. Customer no service and blogs were useless.
137	haleyann34	2	Great idea, too many flaws	I was so excited to get this. My internet is too weak, and I can't get my phones hotspot to connect and set it up. I can't use it at all. Very disappointed. I've read where in the past people were able to connect using their phones hotspot and now the feature isn't working. This is very frustrating!!
138	happypizza	5	Affordable and does the job!	Wish I knew about the chrome cast earlier, this device serves all my needs—Netflix, Hulu, YouTube. My only con is that the phone is your remote, I wish they created a remote to be paired with the chrome cast. Otherwise, this is a wonderfully affordable device that does exactly what you need!
139	BestBuyReviewer	1	Not reliable	The product lasted less than a month before failing.
140	Dmartino	2	Took it back	Returned when I realized the fire stick could be used instead
141	Fraud295	1	Product didn't function.	"product never stream. Called Directvnow support they said there ARE problems with device they could not ,repair.
 I purchased a Fire stick, there still are problems but I Am Working On Them With Directvnow
 Will Return The Chromecast Device. IT IS USELESS."
142	Kail	5	Well just great	Super easy to use and no hassle set up. Best after you cast, casting is totally independent of your phone, you can do anything with you phone without interrupting cast.
143	Palp01	2	Not hotel friendly	I bought this to hook up to the hotel tv and watch things, however you can't get it connected as it lacks a popup webpage to enter the hotel internet code. So not hotel friendly
144	Pedro	1	Did not work well	Unit was slow with video and audio not in sync and no resolution.
145	Melman	1	did not work well	"poor product
gave to charity because not worth the drive back to the store and bought another elsewhere though we are or were loyal to best buy"
146	Brian	2	No remote	Works well but the phone as the remote thing got inconvenient for me
147	MrFitzu	2	Needs wifi i	Not good unless you have internet with wifi. Not good in a RV
148	Greg	2	Great	"Great product 

However Best Buy Return policy is HORRIBLE."
149	Safarinate	1	Don't buy, avoid the aggravation	It works, over and over again usually 3 to 4 times a show... Reboots itself all the time at random turns off at random and usually takes like 20 minutes of fussing to even start watching anything. But it dose work just has a mind of its own and a real pain, I got tired of being burned by Roku, I have a fire stick in the bedroom works great all the time, i thought I'd like to try the chrome cast as I thought the idea of running it off my tablet or phone was a great idea.. Not to mention thier cast app really sucks.. So you will need to download all the apps you'd like to watch for each channel / network.all wanting to update all time and of course send back reports of your activity so they know what advertising to throw at ya. Tying up my tablet even more.. Arrrrggggg.
150	AlfredG7	2	I don't care for this.	I thought this product would solve a couple of issues I have but it has only added to them. I would have returned this thing already but I cannot find the receipt
151	CEYEA	5	Excellent	"Ive purchased this just for Air Play,I have 4 Apple TV won't air play anymore,Then Ive purchased 4 fire sticks ,Fire stick is garbage.
I like the Chromecast easy to Air play from our iPads and iPhones Bobby movies. movie box and Bobby HD movie works awesome.
All my TVs are Samsung why isn't Samsung TVS there not built in chrome cast like VIZIO ?
I won't be buying a Vizio .
Kids love to Air play Movies,I only purchased it to for AIR play
I bought 3 getting 2 more,$35 no brainer"
152	Wayno	1	Didn't work.	Had to return. It wouldn't keep streaming. Went with Roku instead.
153	Mike	1	I would give ZERO stars!	It hardly worked and the features are horrible!!!!! Save the money
154	Matt	1	Sorry it's junk and doesn't work	I've never once gotten this to work right away. Every single time I want to cast, I have to doa complete setup from the beginning. The screen will show the right name, network, pin - the phone will say, no devices found. Or, the phone will say it's casting, and the TV has a black screen, or screensaver. It takes at least 3 tries and 30 minutes to get it to work. I also have an Amazon firestick on another TV and it works perfectly every time, just turn it on and it works.
155	User	1	Limited functionality	"This device has a number of problems with it. In comparison to the competition, chose a Roku instead. I initially bought this for screen casting and for watching videos like hulu, amazon.
It doesn't work with amazon services. Why? I'm guessing that Google doesn't want to play nice with Amazon.
It only can screen cast from a chrome browser nicely. Everything else is cumbersome. We find that you always need to find your phone to control the device if there is a problem with it, such as over-heating. Overall, I should have bought only a 2nd Roku device, which has a controller, better privacy settings, works with every streaming service, and can screen cast."
156	jrmitch85	1	Google Hasn't figured it out	I have to continually reset the chromecast to get my devices to connect. I hate it.
157	Anonymous	1	sucks	Told I could sync my phone to tv but can only receive google related garbage. returning.
158	NICK	1	Disappointed	I was told by the Best Buy employee that this product would be compatible to my tablet. This info is incorrect.
159	Danny	1	Didn't like it	I purchase this for working with the Slingbox 500. It did not work very well with it at all. It would work for a few minutes then disconnect from internet. Ended up getting the Roku Streaming Stick which worked great and you are able to do a lot more with the Roku for $5 more on cost.
160	dire	1	Not good	Without a phone it's useless. Sometimes disconnect from WiFi. I'm going to return it.
161	Sunny212	1	Google Chromecast	Did not work out of the package. Unfortunately, I did not try to set up right away so too late to take back to Best Buy. It was just after the 15 days. So I called Google Chromecast. After they put me through all the testing as well and decided I had a bad product. Their system for returns SUCKS. If I don't want to open a Google acct., then they wait until they receive my product back. Once they log into their system, they will send me a new one. SO I TRUST THEM. THEY DON'T TRUST ME. Sorry I ever bought the product.
162	Lucas	1	Bad	The chromocast is not worki g well. I already bought 3 of them and ar ok. But this one dont stay conected for the time is on. I will love to have a refund. Im in argentina and i can not return it
163	Grunt64	1	Google - Chromecast - Black	I tried and tried but it would not link up. After 2 hours I gave up
164	Sdgopes	5	Great buy	Works great with my sony Smart TV. Would recommend to buy this.
165	LadyRysuka	4	Just okay	I bought 2 of these because I upgraded my Hulu to the live tv service and can't watch it on roku yet so I bought these. They work fine my only complaint is that sometimes they lose connection to my internet to easily or I can't get it to connect and have to reset the device.
166	Dick	2	problems using	I can not get most things to project using a LG Stylos 3. Could be operator error but I have tried for hours and read up on everything i can find.
167	bestbuy50	1	Problem s	"This Device Is Attached To Television For Directvnow To Stream. I Contantly Get The Messages ""Brain Freeze"" On My Screen. I Have Chat With Directvnow Multiple Times. They Say It's A Problem With Chromecast Device."
168	Teee	1	Disappointed	Not user friendly. Returned the Chromecast. Difficult to set up. No remote, you must use your phone.
169	Movie	1	Not for all apps	The store rep told me I can use this to what movies from my phone to my tv. I asked if it had to be a chrome cast app and he said no. Long story short yed, it needs to be a app that is affiliated with chrome cast. Look at the apps on the box and don't ask the sales guy
170	Nana	1	Couldn't setup item to complicated	I initially attempted to set the item up but was not successful, tried qeek squad they tried to help but still no result, to frustrated to continue wrestling with the device so returned it.
171	Chiliskiss12	1	Not the best	I due like this but whet for nothing get disconnected from the internet and you need to star everything again
172	Genealogy4me	2	Returned it, I didn't like it	I returned it to the store. I didn't like it because you have to download each app to your phone and then cast it to the TV, changing the volume was slow and if you want to pause it, it was about a 15 or more second delay. Down loading apps can take up some space on your phone as well. I prefer a remote control.
173	bhuvan	1	Does not cast the videos seamlessly.	The video quality is not good when casting on TV through mobile. it starts buffering at times.
174	Lula1	1	Not too much to do with it.	I did not like it because you can do many of its features with your smart phone. The apps I want it to use it with were not compatible so I ended up having no use for it.
175	Brandjorr	4	Chromecast	I have used all streaming devices especiallt since cutting yhe cord 4 years ago and found that i love what the chromecast does. Many apps over have added so there is no reason for the old work arounds as before. Love this device
176	Tiny	1	Didnt work	It didn't work for my phone. I read reviews saying it would.
177	Chrissa	1	Not too impressed	Not too impressed with this purchased. Returned & got the Amazon Fire Stick. It fit my needs better
178	tnajuanx	1	Poor quality	My Chromecast worked for about 4 months, and then I had problems connecting it to my TV. It would play a Youtube video for a few minutes and then lose connection. The device was basically restarting itself while unprompted. I had to contact Google to get a replacement device, which has been working okay for now. I have a few family members with the first generation Chromecast and those seem to be more reliable than the new round ones.
179	Peachbunny	1	Not so great	Problems with keeping it from freezing not so happy with this
180	Rayme	1	Good attachment	Very hard to install. Still isn't working. Need help.
181	Charlie	1	Horrible	9 out of 10 attempts to cast results in an error message. I use Direct TV Now. When streaming normal programming, and I am able to get this thing to cast, it's alright. If I try to watch an on demand program the show is unwatchable due to constant buffering. I have no problems watching anything on my Apple TV on the same TV, so it's not my internet speed or TV.
182	LOS211	5	chromecast	Easy setup. works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
183	Mattrocity	5	Inexpensive and functional	Really improved upon since the first chromecast was released. It's much more port friendly in its design! Primarily I use it to stream Netflix and YouTube on my TV to give my consoles a rest from being entertainment workhorses so they don't wear out faster. You can also use it to play Cards Against Humanity without all the mess with everyone who has a smartphone! A very good buy. Just make sure you purchase the one you need.
184	Lottie	5	Great	Easy to use. Instructions simple. Works great. Love it
185	LisaJamz	1	Did not like this product whatsoever.	Didn't like. Movies didn't play. Installed right..
186	Blueizs96	4	Great!	Works great with my phone and any device I am stream from. It does sometimes glitch or gets disconnected some how but that's easy to fix.
187	patrick	1	Not doing what I was hoping for	Can't stream xfinity to tv like I was told by both salesclerk and in store xfinity rep.
188	Bgarcia2	1	Do not use	It's kinda useless. I wouldn't recommend you to buy it.
189	Bmoney	1	Most frustrating device	Since day one there was connectivity problems. I sometimes the signal just wouldn't work. My phone would be working fine but the chromecast wasn't reading it. I literally had to stand right next to it at times.
190	reviewchecker	1	did not work for me	I am sure this is a great product, but it would not work at all with my tv(philips 42 inch from 2007) tried troubleshooting online,and something about the power source not being adequate with some tvs. picture just phased in and out in 1/2 second bursts
191	Beccaboo2	2	Not great	I was excited about the Chromecast but ultimately it was a huge disappointment. I had issues with it always lagging/glitching, not turning on properly, disconnecting, and connection errors. I used to run my laptop with an HDMI and I think I'm going to return to that method because I never had as many problems.
192	Brayton	1	Sucks!	Required device! Sucks more than Roku! Bad device!
193	carlela	1	Not for me	Did not realize you had to use only your phone apps for it to work on the tv
194	Yonny	1	Could not get it to work.	Not working even after extensive ChromeCast Support!!
195	Ziggy	1	Aweful	I hated the chromecast. Had it for one day and returned it. Didn't like that to use it I had to do everything on my phone. And if I wanted to look at something I didn't have an app for it made me get the app
196	hotness	1	not happy	The device works fine. But the LED light on the device is flashing. Which makes me think there is a problem with it. Have to keep an eye on the chromecast.
197	VicR	1	ChromeCast	This device does not let me cast just anything from my tablet or phone to the TV. Not the fault of the device, but the fault of the apps on the tablet or phone that block the Chromecast and say you have to use their approved method.
198	MikeSrR	1	difficult to set up	just very difficult to bring online. Even with help from Customer Service I was unsuccessful and very frustrated. I may try again another time. Not good
199	Base002	1	No changes from the old ine	No improvement wanted to steam photo and video on wd my cloud and it's a FAIL
200	Bigbob	5	Easy to use	Useful and easy to use. Streaming to the big screen is much easier on old eyes.
201	JFurr	1	Would not work	Could not get it to link to my Ipad, phone , etc. to stream anything to the TV. My daughter also purchased one and had the same issue.
202	txfireguy	4	Good, but connectivity flaws	I love the concept and when it works, it's great. We have frequent connectivity problems with the device that require restarts of either the Chromecast, the phone, or the Google Home app.
203	gcohen6	1	Chromecast Crappage	"This is one of the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. All I wanted was a way to send the video from my Motorola X Pure to a tv.when I traveled. The geek squad told me it would work, so I bought it. 

What they didn't say is that it requires a connection to the internet. And the hotel internets are so slow, it was useless. And trying to get it to connect was a nightmare. I finally brought it back to Best Bey and got my money back."
204	Robert	4	No issues	Works well, only down side is it bugs out sometimes when swapping between casting programs (ie. Youtube>twitch)
205	Saboken	4	Almost perfect	I needed something to use with my Unlimited BingeOn video hotspot this was my best option the only issue was the huge update it forced me to do before I could use it! This took a big chunk out of my data that's not part of the BingeOn plan! Also it will ship data in the background when idle 10-20 Meg's a day with the Photos Google pushes through you can trim this with semi complicated hack using Google Photos and. Couple small photos to save on data if you are using this in a full-time RV situation like me. It's much better than screen mirroring from a Android device except for the rouge data issue I mentioned.
206	Drew	1	Don't buy one!	Unless you're going to use your phone as the remote, it's pretty useless. Neither of my tvs which are less than 3 years old will connect the remote to it. Until they sell it with its own remote, it's basically a piece of garbage. Fire Stick is way better!
207	DavidJ	4	Works great	it's a very small device but has a lot of power. I love my chromecast it gives me the ability to stream my Netflix and Hulu in a device that fits in my pocket. Also makes a great travel companion to convert any HD tv into a smart tv.
208	gracieladelarua	1	I didn´t receive the item	Hi! I don´t know how to claim. I didn´t receive it
209	Mimi	1	Returned item	I was excited to explore other options besides cable and purchased the Chromecast. Personally I just did not like trying to use my phone as a remote. Being a little old school, I like the idea of having a remote. I am sure it is a great product for those who like using their phone for everything. It just wasn't for me.
210	TexasTraveler	1	Need hi speed Wi-Fi	"Purchased to use with my phone while on the road
Will not maintain a connection with hotel WiFi disconnected every few minutes. Tried using with cell phone no good took it back for refund."
211	JandD	1	would not work	Could not get it to link to my Ipad, phone , etc. to stream anything to the TV. My daughter also purchased one and had the same issue.
212	KenNikonbag	5	Good product simple and easy to install	Good product simple and easy to install I recome=mend this product
213	scottypinthemix	1	terrible	"I really don't care if this thing works or not.
Any piece of hardware that takes 13 hours to do a software update is a P.O.S. in my book.
I should have done some more research on the update problem. It's all over the web."
214	Sonny	1	Did not work	Received item and tried to hook up chrome cast to my tv. It would not work. Gave the chrome cast to a co-worker who has a chrome cast in his home, but he could not get it to work. Not real impressed with item. May try another later, but i waisted money on this item.
215	AJSTractor	5	Functional and easy	Chrome cast offers a flexible easy solution that allows users of mobile products to easily show others on a television what they are researching, watching, or even playing as a game with a touch of the button.
216	googler	1	Does not work as advertised	This item does not work as advertised. It would not hook up with the directions provided and it would not connect to the internet. The AMAZON fire stick worked perfectly!
217	Cdrmaker	4	Easy viewing	Allows easy casting of cell phone video to hdmi enabled tv
218	KK99	5	Love It!!!	A must buy for everyone even if you have a smart tv!
219	laserwizard	1	Very underwhelming item	"I had purchased the original Chromecast and it was acceptable. I really didn't have much in the way of issues with it. It was neither a bad thing or a good thing.

I decided to upgrade thinking that with my 5ghz AC network, this would be an amazing upgrade. I had no idea that this gadget would refuse to connect to a 5ghz network and that this was a huge problem that is known to Google. For over a year this has happened and the only remedy appears to be to fiddle with the perfectly good and operational wireless network to rename and to do other things to get Chromecast to work at its peak.

I cannot recommend this inferior piece of equipment - it is not better than the old one which seemed to work better. I am no novice at home networking and wireless things. There is no reason to have to fiddle with a network to make some device work like it should from the factory. And no other devices have any problem logging onto the network. Is is so frustrating for a device to see a network connection and to repeatedly never connect to it.

Save your money and buy something else."
220	sblasl	1	Returned Product	"Chromecast did not meet my expectations. Would not recommend this product for ""cord cutters"". Amazon FireStick is probably a better product for ""cord cutters""."
221	MrLimpet	5	Magic. Pure magic!!!!	I can't believe it. One minute I'm squinting and trying to watch a video on my phone and then presto I chromcast and I'm watching the same video larger then life. Chromcast turned me into the magician that I always wanted to be. Look out David Blane. Magic. Pure magic.
222	Bart72	4	Works well	Got this item to cast from my tablet to the TV....seems to work well, but the video sometimes breaks up.
223	Ferro77	3	video it`s ok but sound?	No sound after 5 minutes into a movie, then it gives you and error; and takes you to a different screen.
224	Anthony	5	Exactly what I needed	This is a nifty device at a reasonable price. I was looking for something to cast my photos and videos easily without having to hook up cables to my TV. This is a great alternative if you have a non-smart TV, of course, it's not the same, but good enough for my needs.
225	jimt	1	I never used it. I couldn't figure it out.	rather difficult to use. I used an HDMI cable instead much easier.
226	Mshyvonny	1	Worst	This was not a good purchase for me didn't know every movie needs to be purchase
227	jzep	1	Did not work as I was told	Wasted my money on this product. I bought with understanding I could cast using IPhone, only to find out it doesn't.
228	mattiice	5	The best cost effective streaming device	I have Apple TV in my bedroom, I have Android TV in my basement. I know how to use streaming services on both. Purchased Chromecast for my Family room and love it. This is the cheapest, most reliable piece of technology, working with your smartphone and TV. Don't waste your money buying smart TVs. TV Manufacturers are not updating their software so often. Buy cost effective TV + chromecast and enjoy HQ picture and streaming services.
229	travelnut	1	Does not work with Sling	I had purchased this to use with my sling subscription - it does not work
230	BBupgrade	1	Google gimmicks	I was not satisfied with the product and reading the privacy notice. I felt that privacy is at risk if using this product. There are other streaming devices that do not fringe upon privacy the way that Google does.
231	Nm1n7h4H0us3	5	An awesome TV experience!	My girlfriend got me a Google Home as a gift for Christmas. So, I decided to get a Google Chromecast for streaming Nexflix, HBO NOW, Spotify, etc. I totally love this piece of gear. It works awesomely, specially with my Google Home. It's very simple to set up and use, and it responds super fast to my Google Home commands. I will definitely recommend it. For the price, you'll get an awesome TV experience.
232	BigEd	1	This thing is useless	The whole concept behind this product confuses me. It worked ok I guess but I found I really didn't need it. My Iphone could stream to my tv the same way.
233	tvwatcher	1	did not work on my tv	Spent hours trying to get it to work. Have older model and it worked for a year or so and stopped. Thought I needed new model. Same problem of not getting connected. Spent hours on phone with chrome cast help and also Samsung (TV brand I have). Samsung then said my 2008 TV was too old. But it had worked with my first Chrome cast device at one time so it is a mystery. Returned it and just use my wifi Blue Ray to get online.
234	Elzorro	1	Very..very...poor	I gat a 2008 Sony Bravia HD TV. Its signal was weak, couldn't use it.
235	Marv	1	Awful	Make sure your tv had enough ports before you buy.
236	Brett47	1	Don't do it!	Look up the hundreds of threads on the Google product forums. There are a couple of threads from 2014 that are still updated by users who have the same exact problem almost 3 years later with little to no help from Google. I am one of the unlucky few that have this problem and Google still refuses to do any sort of a refund (bought from the Google store) because they believe all of these cases are based on the router/smartphone even with everyone have a different combo. The majority of reviewers seem to have no problem but if you are unlucky you won't get any problems fixed.
237	Redrum	1	Not for everyone.	Unless you know how to reconfigure your router or have one that this works with don't buy it. Will not work with most routers. The ones it will work with you need to get into the administration settings on the router to make it work.
238	Jjones	1	Not happy	It took over my Internet connection. I had to disconnect the device. Not happy at all
239	Enfield303	4	not so good for hulu	Works great for everything other than Hulu. Netflix and YouTube work great. Even works with free Spotify account. Casting Hulu is hit or miss, usually miss. It loads and plays maybe a minute of a show, the errors out. Sometimes after multiple attempts it finally streams uninterrupted, but other times it just won't work. I don't think it is a Chromecast issue as much as a Hulu app issue, but it is annoying. Roku never had problems with Hulu. Sometimes I run my old Roku LT just to avoid the hulu issue.
240	Buck1234	1	Samsung Galaxy S-7 incompatible	Sticker warning for S6 on box but not any warning for S7. Chromecast actually not the problem. But Samsung took out miracast.
241	PaddyJ57	1	Crude	"In this day and age, there is no reason for a streaming device to not communicate seamlessly with different hardware. Online help is limited and virtually useless. If I download app on Android, it works in Chromecast. If I download in IOS, the app works in iTunes. The two simply will not play nice together.

Also, the app only works with mobile devices. Why not Windows or iOS? Can nobody conceive that it would be nice to stream from a desktop or laptop?

Hopefully this will change, but after spending 2-3 hours I'm done for now."
242	BBupgrade	1	Google gimmicks	Collects data just like any other google product. I was skeptical about the purchase but went against my better judgement.
243	aircomposite	1	Frustrating!	Well all this does is let your IPhone connect to the TV! The program is hard to learn and get's extremely frustrating to get a movie. (I actually haven't gotten one yet) They force you to upgrade and it still doesn't work! You need to buy the movies and shows any way so I will stick with Netflix!
244	Jordan	1	Terrible	Never works when we need it to, is really slow, and anytime we try to connect a device to it, it can never find the device. Definitely would never buy this again and we are soon going to switch to something else.
245	Mike	4	Great chromecast	Great chromecast but it does not work whit Samsung grand prime.
246	Bekee	1	Not very clear	I both this chromecast after reading other people's review. I needed it to stream movies from my laptop to tv, but it was very blurry and would freeze. The movies were clearer on my laptop, so I returned it.
247	dave	1	no idea	Unable to even give a review since I have not been able to even use it.
248	jupitorjue2k2	4	Chromecast Gen 2 Nice product	It works fast seamlessly with most of the TVs. It supports YouTube, NetFlix FandangoNow and most other programs. Also take note that it does not support Amazon Prime Streaming. Also I think there are limited capabilities with SlingTV as well. Product is fast and good where it work, but not compatibility with Amazon prime doesn't make favorite choice for me.
249	TAKH	1	awful	Cannot get this to work no matter what I try. I guess it doesn't;t work if you have Time Warner Cable. Worked for hours trying to get it to work, but no matter what I tried, no matter what suggestion were made, nothing worked.
250	Mnon	5	Great Product	Its a great product to watch your youtube videos on your TV, and best part is that you can mirror your smart phone and can watch everything on your TV including Facebook videos and web contents.
251	Gemm	1	Good but to many other product better	Smart TVs...apple TVs...Xbox one else screen castingredients all the same
252	Dude123	1	Not easy to use	I bought it for my dad and he could not understand how to use it. It was supposed to be easy to set up but it took over an hour for the initial set up.
253	need4speed	5	Great way to stream from mobile	Chromecast offers a great way to easily stream content from many different apps even on iPhone. It has some glitches from time to time, but mostly this is due to poor programming on the individual app not on Google's end.
254	mrsjballard	1	Such a hassle	We had ours two days and returned it. It wasn't as quick set up as they make it seem....we went with firestick!
255	Nelson	5	great device	streaming is fast and easy. the quality if good perfect and I ended up buying two
256	duanne76	1	Chromecast	Don't understand the purpose of this device. That's why I returned it!
257	consumerinaz	1	Have gotten it to work just once	"I bought this to be able to watch the live webcams on explore.org on a Sony non-smart TV. So far it has only worked once. I know I set it up correctly. I called Customer Service with ChromeCast and was able to get it to work once while on the phone with them but not since. I select ""YouTube"" when watching the webcam on my PC and then ""cast to ChromeCast,"" but it doesn't work. I guess I need to call Customer Service again or have a computer geek help me."
258	Hectorgrios1	1	Not a great idea	In order for you to use this is has to be connected to your mobile device. I can just use screen mirror it's the same thing. Don't recommend it
259	Markis408	4	Neat device... But..	I can't cast Xfinity to my TV using it. I stream live TV over the Internet with Comcast, but Comcast blocks the use of the device.
260	Serena	1	Would not buy if this wasn't on sale	Husband bought this on Black Friday and it was on sale. It is a convenient thing to have but not a necessity. For what he paid for, I think it was still okay. If this wasn't on sale, I probably would have discouraged him to get this.
261	NJST	3	Good for kids maybe....	"Bought this hoping it would do more than it actually does do. My 7 year old grandson likes ""casting"" YouTube clips from his tablet to his TV using it, but that novelty will wear off quickly, I suspect. Bought it for $35 and now its official price is $25. Soon they'll just be giving these things away before they finally become totally obsolete."
262	JimA	1	Did not work for me	Needed to hook to my tv to watch from my phone. It did not let me do that. Not sure this was made for my phone. I have a Droid.
263	FewSick	1	Get an Apple TV	I don't like having to use my phone as a remote and most of the apps I want such as HBO Now are not available as an app and I downloaded multiple apps trying to Mirror or *cast* from my iPhone and was unsuccessful. So, I bought a second Apple TV.
264	photoj	1	Overheats after 5 minutes	"I tried to take back to refund. The line was too long. Came back and the 15 day window closed. All I have is something for the ewaste trash bin.
Skip version1 !!!!!"
265	Kiwi	1	Would not stay connected.	Would connect and then immediately disconnect, returned the product
266	Djae	3	Get an apple tv	I wouldn't recommend it, get the Apple TV instead lots of bugs...
267	DEEPAK	5	Awesome Device	the chromecast is really good. it works as my digital frame and I can cast my crome browser from my laptop.
268	Zoomancer	5	I love this critter	I have brought the chromecast with me on trips and have one plugged into my television all the time. Just bought another one for my daughter.
269	emdonald	5	Perfect for streaming	This is an must have for anyone that watches online shows and movies, streams, or watches YouTube videos.
270	Edge	5	I like it	I liked it so much got one of the other tv in the house
271	Daemun	5	Easy to use, works as promised	Excellent for bolstering your home entertainment platform, especially for entertaining guests, easily cast videos or games to your tvs cheaply.
272	MyBestBuy	5	Good Product	Does as it is advertised. Good for upgrading your tv to start experiencing how watching television will eventually be conducted in the future. Streaming is here to stay.
273	levi	5	easy to use	Great little device! Easy to use, even for someone who does not feel they are technically inclined.
274	Bigcree	1	Couldn't cast Pandora	Try ed casing cell phone but didn't work. Also wouldn't work with laptop wouldn't recommend this to anyone
275	CindyPgh	5	Working great with ethernet connection	We encountered problems connecting to Amazon Prime, but after connecting the Chromecast to the home network via ethernet, we are able to watch tv shows and movies without any lag or picture problems. We use a desktop computer to cast.
276	Donna	1	It didn't work good to me.	After 30 mins it would stop working. It was not at all what I expected.
277	durga	1	The worst product from Google	I wouldn't recommend this product. Google Chrome never shows up my device in the cast list. It requires a reboot minimum of 10 times a day. I wish to give a 00000 rating
278	NewAndroid	1	Great for casting apps	This is great for casting apps and music to your TV. It's too bad Best Buy would not do a price adjustment when they lowered their price after I bought it.
279	VolusiaCaptain	1	Connections and required devices too limited	"Having set up Roku boxes, and streaming DVD/media players and network cameras for years, I figured Google would make the Chromecast a piece of cake. Not so. Very disappointed that our Samsung S-7 phones or Tab E, or our friend's iPhone can't ""see"" the Chromecast device on the same network/router much of the time, just 25 feet away or less. And depending upon what you are casting to the device, you may need to let that other computer or device remain tied up with the source page in order for the Chromecast to continue displaying what you tried to cast to it, so very disappointed ! Would return it if I could."
280	Melysintat	4	Does what it needs to	What this product offers is simplicity itself. It's easy to set up, looks great and can do almost anything you would want. I took off 1 star for two reasons: One, it doesn't have a remote, everything is done by your smart phone or tablet (or google home now), and two in order to connect to Amazon Prime for streaming you need to go around it by mirroring your phone which means you cannot use your phone while showing something on Amazon Prime. Other than that I love it and I've had a couple Rokus, as well as a Fire Stick from Amazon.
281	Lenovo	1	good	a great product that i would recommend to my friends
282	Baby10smom	5	Love my chromecast	My husband got my first Cromecast for Christmas two years ago loved it so much I got one for my daughter
283	Googletastic	5	GREAT and well worth it	Great way to watch my shows from Netflix. I love that I can just throw up anything from my phone or laptop onto my 50 inch television. Great concept and LOW price.
284	SalR	5	Chromecast ....!!!!	Great for streaming YouTube and Netflix. I can mirror my desktop too. Best product for the price
285	Nick	5	Simply Easy!	This is a great and simple product. This product only works if you have a mobile device or tablet FYI. For example, you plug this into your HDMI port in your tv, but the only way to setup is by using your device to download the app in order to use. If you need a 100% standalone product, then look into the amazon firestick. The simplicity of this product at the price point is a great buy! When you are in your youtube, netflix, pandora, or any other supported app on your phone, simply stream it to the tv and it works, You dont have to keep your phone on or anything, just continues to play. Youtube what i mean for more clarification on how this works!
286	HealthandFitness4Life	1	Keeps glitching	I haven't had the chance to return this product as of yet, because of my work schedule, but it has got to go. I own the older model and that works perfectly. I got the new model and put it on a new TV in my home and it keeps glitching, and the router is right next to it. Please put the old model back on the market. THANK YOU
287	deburnt1	1	not with my phone	Did reviews, bought it, get home to find put it will not work with Windows 10 phone. Returned it and bought a Roku.
288	kuma	4	useful and affordable	really nice product. can't give it 5 stars because there are still many apps and services that do not support it, Amazon Prime for example won't cast to chrome. also the new update to the google home app makes things a little more complicated.
289	TomThumb	1	Works great	Allows streaming of a number of channels. Excellent addition to you TV watching.
290	Nita	1	Not worth it. Nothing like advertised on t.v	"It kept going off and on when it went off it would say error.
I returned mine at Best Buy in San Jose Ca On Curtner at the Plant shopping center with no problem the lady was very nice."
291	happy16	1	super proudct returned--my tv was not smart, sad.	did not fit my old tv, which is not a smart tv it tiurns out..
292	JamesMoore	1	My experience was poor	I have been happy with my first gen chromecast, wanted to upgrade to the new version. New chromecast worked for about 2 weeks and then disconnected and will reconnect but will not stream video, only audio. I have spent hours resetting the CC and my modem in different combinations to no avail.
293	TexasGoogleChromecastUser	5	Much Improved Over Version 1	I have been using the original Chromecast (version 1) in my home on two TV's. I really have enjoyed using it but it does come with its issues such as a degraded picture quality and having on and off connection issues with the wireless router (strength and consistency). I upgraded to this version (version 2) so that I could utilize the 5 GHz bandwidth from my new router. This has helped the signal strength and the overall quality of the picture. I am very pleased with the updates from version 1 to version 2. The only drawback I have is that I preferred the smaller, and more slender footprint of the version 1 device, even with the HDMI extender being used. All in all, I am very satisfied.
294	Davor	1	Google cromecast	Great and very usefull product.I am very satisfied with IT.
295	Hann	1	Keeps on updating	Activated and after syncing, it says again that it was updating. Never ending
296	Anarchy9903	1	not really needed	i used the thing once no need to use again you got netflix
297	Gene	5	Excellent product	Great product,very easy to learn and use. I love it!
298	Sion2	1	Picture	Box says streams up to full HD shows well it does not at all
299	Ahmad	1	The worst	I don't recommend it. I have to install it everytime I turn on the tv .wate of time. It's the worst . I went to replace it but they told me that I must have returned it within 15 days from the purchase , not 20 days . Worst experience ever
300	Cubsfan	1	I wish it just worked!	I used my chrome for the first time to stream NCLS Cubs game 3. It wasn't great! It kept replaying plays over and over again while it was streaming perfectly on my computer. I tried streaming from my phone and it kept buffering every 30 seconds. I wish you could buy a product and it just worked the way it is supposed to!!!
301	apple	1	New but not improved	Had trouble locating the device. Setup was done correctly as I have the 1st generation. Difficult, to say the least
302	Klainers	1	Not the best	I thought I was getting this to work with all of my products but I come to find out thanks to google that it will not work with apple products.
303	Jaimie	5	Big fan	I love Chromecast I got it as a present. Sadly after a year it acted up and I did have to buy a new one. Other than that it's been great. It works well with many apps. I can even cast videos from Facebook to my tv. I highly recommend it. Very easy to install as well!!!
304	PriyankB	4	Good streaming solution at low cost	A very cost effective solution as compared to other streaming devices in the market. Though the unavailability of amazon prime is a sore point. I don't see this lacking behind apple tv on any point.
305	Genius	5	Google Chrome Cast	This is a great product and I bought 2 of them because it is very convenient to utilize this to cast any video from the internet and be cast to the Chrome Cast. Thanks Google!!!
306	Lori	1	None	"It does not work on any of our tv'
Don't send me a question when I have said all I need to and I can't send cause its not enough. 
The product does NOT WORK FOR ME."
307	JohnnyTran	4	Great, but not perfect	I love using my chromecast to cast from the comfort of my couch with ease. It's a great device, but it's not without it's flaws. A lot of times it won't pause and play as intended. I'll have to exit out of the app and start again. This isn't such a huge deal but can be quite aggravating sometimes. It works with most streaming services but some apps don't support it so be sure to double check before you purchase it! Amazon prime and Xfinity tv come to mind. Overall I love my little device as it makes life a lot easier! I'd recommenced to anyone looking for a cheap all in one streaming solution!
308	Stephen	1	Poor equipment.	I got this to work exaxtly two times. It doesnt even recognize my tv anymore. Only recognizes the digital cable boxes.
309	Dollar	1	Not what I expected	Thought I would be able to cast EVERYTHING from my IPad to the TV, WRONG!!!!! Guess I didn't read all of the reviews thoroughly enough.
310	Deni	1	Returned it	Picture quality was poor, The picture would be really good and then it would fade to be really bad and then it would come back it was not what I wanted.
311	Kelvyn	5	Great product	"Chromecast is not a computer, tablet or phone... so keeping that in mind, review it for what it is.... a casting device, and for that is great!

I can have my PC casting chrome apps or sites directly to my tv.
Same for my tablet or phone.... not difficult setup (though initial setup was required the first time you boot it up, and you need your phone for that)

the only CON I find is that it is not an independent device, like fire tiv or other similar products... but those are features it does not advertise, since it is sold solely as a casting device, and for that is GREAT.

Recommended to have at least one in your house, then you will see how useful it is."
312	JrJangoFet	5	Awesome 2Gen Product	Had the 1st generation chromecast and it did not have wireless N capability. That has been fixed with this version and the connection is almost instant. Highly recommended.
313	BWFerg78	5	Love it	I'd been hearing good things about Chromecast for a couple of years, now I know why. I just recently got rid of satellite because it wasn't worth spending that much money every month on 250 channels with nothing on. I signed up for Netflix and Hulu, and was using an HDMI MHL cable with my old phone. The Galaxy S7 I just upgraded to wasn't compatible with that cable, so I had to buy a Chromecast. I'm glad I did. Now I can cast without having my phone hooked up to a cable by the TV. My phone acts as a remote, which is a bonus. I also like that you can mirror your phone screen to the TV for those apps that don't support Chromecast. All in all, a great product.
314	Zandolee	1	Not what I expected	Basically this is a device that allows you to stream from your portable device. There are no built in apps. I should have just gotten an AppleTV.
315	Karen	4	Very happy	We have been very happy with our Google Chromecast purchase. It was very easy to install and set up and works just as advertised. Gives access to a tremendous amount of channels and content, although there is still some programming not available on Chromecast that we would like to see available there, such as DirecTv programming and some other live network programming. This is why I am not giving it 5 stars. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. Overall, the Chromecast is a great addition to a TV that does not already pick up cable or satellite coverage, and even to those that do.
316	Marvin216	1	Chromecast suck!	"I wish I had not thrown my receipt away!! This thing drops every 5 minutes. As soon as Im getting into a movie that I have mirrored from my tablet, the signal drops and I have to spend time reconnecting my tablet to my Chromecast. 
If Google is reading this, please let me know how I can return this for a refund."
317	stew	1	still can't get it to work !	see above . itg doesn't work and i've even had my 10 yr old neighbor boy come over and try to male it work
318	BBfan13	1	Chrome cast review	Worked great for my daughter while at home. Once she got to school, could not get Netflix to stream to her tv. Tried all recommended troubleshooting ideas. Could not get to work. Will be returning.
319	Paulreview	1	does not work	"Does not work
No real directions
Just a horrible information but nice packaging"
320	Paradisian	5	Works smoothly with Android	I was having a problem with my First Gen Chromecast, so I bought this one. Screencasting works solidly on this one!
321	Adrian	5	Awesome	Streaming from my laptop, tablet, phone, and being compatible with all the apps I use. Perfect.
322	Jyjan	5	Must Have	A can't live without it type of product. Honestly works better than most smart tv built in functions. I use this daily and have chromecasts in multiple rooms of the house.
323	Chris	5	love it	I love this, it is very easy to hook my phone or tablet up to my TV
324	alanb4130	5	Excellent way to have a smart TV	Google Chromecast works great with your home network to turn your TV into a smart TV. So many options for entertainment. Great if you have Kids. Everything from Youtube Kids to PBS Kids and many other that stream through the Chromecast to your big screen. This is a very affordable device . Definitely worth a try.
325	zach	1	Chromecast	The older version of Chromecast worked a lot better than this. I am not sure why it doesn't stay connected to my phone, or when it is connected it can take up 15 minutes to cast a video.
326	battlerider	5	Easy to cast to TV, no more cables	Great streaming device. No need to fumble with video cables to hook up phone/tablet/pc to your TV. Get on to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video on your device then cast it to your TV.
327	trial	2	did not work for me	it might be good to some people but the piece did not meet what I want to do with it.
328	arty	5	Value for money	I love this little gadget! It makes watching anything online a true pleasure.
329	OldCodger	5	Great way to watch movies	Had some initial problems getting it to work because of the distance from my router. It is recommended to be no further than 15 to 20 feet apart, however, it works great from my Samsung smartphone.
330	Brucerdude	5	Works Great	"Plugged it in. Setup was easy. Streams video from my phone tablet or computer easily. We use it in our company conference room with a 50"" TV.
If you need something that is stand alone to stream media this is not for you. This will only stream from your device and show it on your TV."
331	Audiofile	5	Works great for streaming media from mobile device	Does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.
332	Smoke	5	Works as advertised	The google chromecast works as advertised - delivers video to your TV from a mobile device. Good product.
333	Meroes	4	Excellent	Works great, but you need a good wifi connection and long battery life on your phone.
334	Ebriar	3	Nice	A little intimidating, but over all produced a good outcome.
335	TejasEric	5	Very good streaming device	It's a very easy to use and setup streaming device. It works with Android and iOS which is nice.
336	EnigmaticZero	5	Great add-on for a 4K TV	This was recommended to me by a good friend. It's nearly effortless to install and use. You plug it in to an HDMI port, and you can cast content (like home videos) onto your TV.
337	NickJ	5	Amazing product, easy to use and set up!	This is my fifth Chromecast. I have the first generation all the way to the newest one and I use them on every TV in my house. Not only that, but I've been giving them as gifts to my friends and family for years! The ease of use makes it just as amazing. The best part of having it is being able to name each one independently, so I can choose to 'cast' a video from my phone or tablet to any of the different Chromecast devices I have in my home. Not only that, but there is a guest mode so other people can send stuff to the TV as well! I use it for everything from watching movies and youtube videos to playing music and audiobooks. I love it and cannot recommend it enough!
338	TechEnthusiast	5	Simply excellent but could be technically great	"At its simplest, the Chromecast is a wireless dongle that allows you to stream audio and video from a mobile device to your TV.

It lack instructions in the box, but it is fairly simple to get the device setup.

For the more technically inclined, it is possible to stream local content by typing in the file path into the chrome browser and then streaming that. No additional apps are necessary. I found this worked very well.

Streaming my entire desktop resulted in an unacceptable amount of lag. I'd played with the notion of using this to wirelessly stream games from my Windows laptop, but that isn't going to be feasible.

As an inexpensive device to add functionality to a non-smart TV, the Chromecast is a winner."
339	CasualGamer	5	Good for the Technically Illiterate	Bought this for my parents who liked watching Youtube on their Phones. It connected to our wifi quickly and casts pretty seamlessly. Would highly recommend.
340	Caroline	5	Great way to stream!	"The Chromecast is an awesome product - I'm so glad I got it! Really great easy way to stream from so many devices - phone, tablet, laptop... I love that it's connected over Wi-Fi - no HDMI cable getting in the way.

Very easy, convenient and affordable. I definitely recommend it!"
341	Silas	1	Took it back	Couldn't keep a connection. Kept dropping both laptop and tablet.
342	Khartcordova	5	Great for streaming video from our devices.	We purchased a few Google Chromecasts when it first came out a few years ago. Not only did we love it, our family did as well. We recently purchased two more. An extra for us and another to give as a gift to the family!
343	Tj2274	5	Google Chromecast	Simple to setup and use. Comes with a month of free Netflix and Spotify. Also comes with 3 months of Google music. Haven't had any issues yet. Love the simplicity of it.
344	andpark	5	Easy as pie	So great! We cut the cord and now use 3 Chromecasts throughout the house and life is good.
345	ac18	4	Great overall.	Works perfectly most of the time. A few disconnects once in a while.
346	Arun	1	Casting issues	I had previous version of the chrome cast and I didn't face any issues but the new one creates lot of issues while casting. I am totally fed up with the device and most of the time am using connecting to laptop using HDMI cable. I should have been return this item. I believe previous version is better than the new one.
347	mathieu	3	No special	I think this thing is very limited because you cannot streaming a video from any apps unless it is from youtube or specific apps
348	magnum	5	Easy to install and use	Great item, very easy to install and use and a very friendly tool
349	KenC	5	Excellent Product	Good at casting app and show to your there are tons of apps.
350	AKATINA	5	"Great Puck to ""smart"" your TV"	This is a great inexpensive way to view whatever is currently playing on your device (Ipad, computer, phone). Recommended by Best Buy employee when I was looking for an adapter for the Ipad to watch Netflix on the TV. Saved substantial money by purchasing the puck instead, can use it with all my devices and it works beautifully. Awesome little product.
351	vndragone	5	google chrom	great device works great. love watchng movies with it.
352	Marg	1	Didn't work for our needs	We wanted a streaming device to use in place of our cable TV subscription and Chromecast didn't have enough features and it would stop working. We went with a Fire stick. Much better!
353	Jesse	5	Love Chromecast	It's so easy to use and set up. I have one on all of my TVs and have given a few out to friends as well.
354	Kinji39	5	Perfectly simple	No below and whistles, and that's what makes this thing so great. It has turned my Apple TV into a paperweight.
355	COMPTIATECK	5	Great	this is my forth one since i have 4 tvs. a must if you use showbox
356	mson	5	Excellent for watching videos	Worked perfectly out of the box. Easy set up. Able to watch Youtube and other videos on the big screen
357	skirby12	5	Great Product	I wasn't completely sure of what to expect when I pulled it out of the box and installed it on my TV. It probably works best for me with a tablet that has all of the applications loaded onto it to be able to stream through Google Chromecast. I don't have enough space on my phone to be able to hold all of the apps that I have access to, but other than that, it is a really great product!
358	BLWI	4	Good for pushing video from phone to TV	"After some initial difficulty getting Chromecast installed & functioning, it has worked great. It wasn't as ""plug and play"" as the 3-step installation instructions suggested, but I was able to get tech support from Chromecast. Because MLB.TV doesn't currently support the version of software used by my Samsung Smart TV, I use Chromecast to watch MLB.TV, pushing it from my phone to my TV."
359	Paul	5	Great item!	I use my chrome all the time now. Easy to use and would recommend if anyone asked.
360	Lach	5	Love it!	Great product. Industry standard. Not asure many channels as Roku but better UI and better programming available.
361	Milla	4	Works great	Great product! My boys love to watch their shows on the big screen.
362	Bervidge	5	Great last minute gift.	Purchased as a gift for cousin and he is always streaming something now. He is happy it turned his dumb tv into a smart tv and it only cost me $30+. Not perfect but so worth the money if you have a tablet or phone with all your video steaming apps and movies.
363	jofo	5	Best of the streamers.	"I had a roku, not as good. I bought this for the seamless integration with ""The google."" Great purchase"
364	Dstnhoose	5	Great for streaming video	I have thoroughly enjoyed using the chromecast it allows me to basically turn my older tv into a smart tv
365	Smitty	5	Cheapest, best streamer.	I have had the chromecast since they originally came out with the the stick version. True now a days most consoles, TVs and players have Netflix but for a wall mounted room TV with no cable connection or you just don't want too many wires you can't beat this. You can do all your normal streaming, YouTube, Hulu with ease but even regular online sites just by using Google chrome browser. Definitely worth it. I mean 35 bucks and comes on sale often. Take a chance.
366	maha	5	Great option	This can replace any SMART TV. A portable device that can be with you in any place
367	Bsk8ball34	5	Surprisingly good	Wasn't sure how much I would like this, but i've been greatly impressed
368	DBATC	5	Chromecast	The chromecast worked exactly as advertised. Easy instatllation
369	Itse	5	outstanding product	I have a two chromecast, the clarity is great. super easy to install and use.
370	Tavo	5	does what its meant to	easy to use, easy to connect, great product. a lot more friendly with IOS now.
371	Brad	4	Much more stable connection	"Definitely an improvement over the previous version of chromecast. I no longer have issues with losing my connection partway through watching something. Sometimes I have issues getting the stupid thing to connect from my PC or stopping youtube videos from playing, but these issues are rare. I'm very happy I upgraded to this version and look forward to future upgrades.

For those thinking of buying a chromecast, just do it. This thing has completely changed how I watch videos that would usually be watched on my pc or phone."
372	nance	3	it was very easy to install	I went in to buy an adaptor to use with my amazon prime account - I was assured by the salesperson that this would work. After several attempts to use it with my amazon prime I called amazon they told me it was not compatible. It works with u-tube and several others but not with amazon as I wanted it for. so basically to me this is a useless piece of equipment. So if you want to use it for anything other than Amazon it's great , easy to install & easy to use.
373	Joey	2	It does a fair job but connectivity is flakey.	At times the apps would loose connectivity with the devise. Was very annoying to constantly reconnect.
374	Card	4	Cast phone to bigger screen	Awesome product, was able to use my phone in a presentation,
375	Tina	5	Love it	Definitely a great product for people like me who live on their phone. You connect it right to your tv and anything you are watching on your phone shows up on the tv screen.
376	Abhi	5	Excellent Gadget to Own	I had the previous version of chromecast, Now I have the latest... Its great gadegt to own with great performance
377	spencer910	4	Google - Chromecast	Great little device. Easy to install/setup and use. However there are a few sites that you cannot cast from directly. You can work around it by watching it on your phone and casting your screen. Another negative; you need to pay for most of the sites in the app.
378	Frequency	5	Perfect for Google Users	Regardless of the operating system, the Chromecast is compatible. So long as you use the Chromecast App for iOS or Android or the Chrome web browser for Windows or Mac OS, you are good to go.
379	Traviswr13	5	Great product	Does exactly what it is advertised to do. I would recommend.
380	simong	5	Works beautifully , simple to install and use	This product is essential equiptment to me. Not owning a smart tv it has given me the ability to stream anything thats on my computer
381	patsyrich	1	Completely satisfied in product	I was looking for another item to transmit from tablet to T.V but was advised by sales person to try Chromecast. I had never heard of it but I was pleased that it performed the function that I was looking for.
382	FatalFrosti	5	Great streaming device	The chromecast is a great little device that is inexpensive to hook into your TV and then stream media from your phone, tablet or laptop.
383	Maggie3	4	Great for TV	This is an inexpensive alternative to cable TV. Would highly recommend chrome cast.
384	Hewlett	5	Had to get a second!	I bought the original Chromecast before this new model came out and still have that one, but I wanted a second. This device is GREAT and have had no problems with it!
385	Meli	1	did not like it	The chromecast did not work. It wouldn't work with our WiFi
386	MCATL	4	Cheap and little complicated	It's not a plug and play like the Apple TV. You do have to get the app and connect to your tv but it's so cheap. Once you are all set, it works just as well as Apple TV.
387	AC215	3	It's alright	I bought this more to cast my laptop screen onto the TV...this doesn't work well looks like they need to develop this a little better.
388	Champcole	4	Great product!!!	I gave this Chromecast 4 stars even though it works perfectly. I noticed once I started using it that there are some more prominent apps that you can't access with it. So I ended up purchasing a Roku stick in addition to the Chromecast. Before buying make sure the content you hope to view is carried by Chromecast. Hopefully they'll be licensed to carry more apps in the future.
389	dbrun	5	Great Device for streaming to the tv.	This is the best streaming device I could have ever got I can watch anything I want and it doesn't use a lot of phone battery. I love this over Apple TV.
390	Vicki	5	Great	Easy to use and great reception and great instructions
391	Shell68	5	Excellent Little Device	I have been debating between Apple & Amazon TV for awhile. I saw this & read the reviews & for the price thought I would give it a try for my son so he wouldn't have to watch thru his XBox anymore. Setup is quick & easy and the device works great. Is still plan to buy one of the others for the main TV but this was a start & I couldn't be happier with he purchase.
392	Anonymous	4	Great little gadget	I bought this item to help me cut the cable cord. I recently signed up for PlayStation Vue to watch TV and I bought the chrome cast to put on the TVs in the bedrooms. Now we can watch live TV in all the rooms by casting the Vue app to the TV. There is a slight lag time before it casts but not sure if it is the device or my bandwidth. Overall the product works great. I also love the photos it shows on the TV from my google pictures. Great value.
393	sonaal	3	Better option available	you can purchase this device only if you want to use with android phone otherwise I prefer roku 2 is much better and faster for tv streaming
394	Denabobeno	5	Awesome!	The goggle chrome cast is a really great addition to a kids room.
395	Dennis	5	Awesome!	I love it. I have no complaints at all. Great. Nice!
396	Javaman98	5	Works great, cast everything.	It works great with my Samsung Note 4, not all come with pre made apps. Also the laptop works better, even with no apps.
397	kevinlh2	4	Works great!	Nice to use on the T.V. Very easy to use. Decent picture quality (depending on video web site).
398	JayH	5	Perfect streaming device	This product is a great streaming device. It does it all and best of all you can use your phone.
399	SPatel	5	Great Media Player for cheap	Everyone can make any tv an easy netflix/hbo go machine with this cheap and great product from google! It will not dissapoint in except maybe wireless issues if your tv is in a dead wifi zone in your house/room.
400	ps2xgmr	5	Got the 1st gen, the 2nd gen is even better	The 2nd gen chromecast has faster streaming and can receive 5g signals. Also it looks like it would be less portable but there is a magnet on it that the hdmi cord connected to it can latch onto the device. I love it.
401	CoffeeNut	4	Works Good	Works as described. Was able to hook my phone to it and watch on the big screen.
402	Jaxsondebill	4	Good streaming device	Much better then 1st gen. Does not freeze as much as 1st gen.
403	Sweets	5	Mirroring the phone	I have a Samsung note 5 and I have 2 Chromcast so I can watch a movie from my phone onto my TV screen
404	Aaron	4	Great product	Works great! Streams from Chrome without issues. Regularly use it.
405	BEST	5	Excellent product	This is my 3rd purchase, just amazing..must have item...
406	Amadeus	5	Does the job	My mom likes it and has no Trouble using it and she is no tech wiz
407	Martin	5	Great Product	Very easy to use. Great price, elegant design. Superb.
408	Dolly	5	Great way to watch TV	Great streaming device for video on Internet and also easy to use.
409	CherryJ	5	Love it!	I was debating between a few others and decided on Chromecast because that normally what I use on all my systems. I've been able to watch whatever I wanted to, commercial free! My type of tv!
410	pdubsfc	5	Works great!	My kids love to watch their favorite music videos and You Tube cartoons on the TV! Keeps them happy!
411	Datdude	1	Expected more from this	Difficulty connecting to all the apps it advertise.
412	Carlos	5	Great product	I use this for my business. And all my employees are able to get the slide show going no matter what shift!
413	Fatamama2485	4	Great games and movies	I love how they take care of me when i buy my electroics and have insureunce
414	Tamcalli	5	Great for streaming	Great streaming device. The Google Cast tab on pc is a little laggy but overall a good product.
415	howard	5	works just as described	very versatile! also some apps are cast-enabled so it's extra convenient
416	t5548dm	4	second one	got extra one for upstairs in media room. easy set up.
417	nrich	5	Better than BEATS!	Who knew life could be so great when connect to your home device and hearing quality sound all to yourself without disturbing others!
418	Matias	5	Great product!	Same as older version, this Chromecast is excellent! Recommended.
419	dallasnative	4	Google Chromecast device	This is a good product however it like to log off when I use it with my phone. In other words it will sometimes disconnect from the source that I am using to watch on my tv. Doesn't do it enough to cause me worry or discomfort.
420	Lokesh	5	Awesome Chromecast. I love it. Very much worth	Awesome Chromecast. I love it. Very much worth buying to convert your your TV to smart TV for just 35$
421	LadyS	5	Easy install	Literally a plug and play device. I use this instead of cable, saves money and a huge variety of content to choose from.
422	alex	1	Took it back	Took it back still beta to cast from laptop maybe after they fix the problem
423	mickey	5	faster than 1st gen chromecast	I have the first generation chromecast and just bought a new TV so was time to get another one. If using iPad (I do), best to buy an app to use with the chrome cast (video cast).
424	Pito	5	Streaming made easy!	Great starter streaming device. Google never fails to deliver an excellent product. Easy to set up and user friendly!
425	fspstechd	5	Great Streaming Device	Great Inexpensive streaming device. I bought it for one reason.....to be able to stream HBO Now to my television. I have a smart TV that doesn't have the HBO Now or HBO Go apps on it. Bummer. Anyway, for $35.00 this was a perfect solution. Plug it in, follow the onscreen steps, good to go. Works great.
426	Vignesh	4	Easy to Setup and Easy to use	Very simple to use just click a cast button in your chrome browser
427	Mavs88	5	Works perfect!	Great for streaming things from your phone to your tv. I have a smart tv but still purchased this to stream movies from my phone or ipad.
428	monofree	5	Awesome device	very easy to use. I am getting one for each of my rooms.
429	JACK	5	Easy to use	This is wonderful for watching Netflix. I find the movie on my tablet, click on Chromecast and there it is on my TV. Great.
430	MCNarles	5	Great buy	The whole Chromecast technology is an amazing thing anyway. Awesome to have if you only subscribe to TV shows on your computer.
431	Arnold33	5	Working excellent for its application	This product is being used in an industrial environment and is performing well.
432	NikiG	5	Love it	Based on the reviews of the app in the Play Store, I didn't expect much. However, I'm pleasantly surprised and love this thing. Easy setup, easy to use, and the Google Cast app is completely usable. Usually, I cast from within the app I'm using.
433	dm133333	4	Chromecast	It is nice device. From your mobile phone you can control video on TV.
434	jodom91	3	Great for mirroring.	I really like how easy this product is to use but I feel like they could change how it is set up. For example, I would like to see the Chromecast have a built in software that wasn't so reliant on another device.
435	etraud	2	Slow response, not a Smart TV replacement	"I got this Chromecast to convert one of my old TV's that is not Smart TV into one, but this device is very slow, and is a hit an miss when trying to broadcast to the Chromecast, sometimes it works and sometimes does not. I have a fast Internet and Wireless works perfect on other devices, so it's not the network.
 I have a 3 Years Old Smart TV and it's way faster than this device, and always works, the lack of a Remote control is a pain. You need to use your smartphone as a Remote control, which I knew since the beginning, but I was with the impression that would be fun, it's not, very slow and i's not as reliable as a Smart TV. The best test are the kids, none of my two kids wants to use this TV with Chromecast, they pick the Smart TV without thinking. 
Maybe is not a fair comparison between a smart TV and this Chromecast, but I have seen on several occasions that this device should turn your non-Smart TV into one, it will not, look somewhere else.
Thanks."
436	Sann	5	Excellent product	Great gadget. Liked so well bought my daughter one.
437	LastRus782	4	Worked as it should.	Improved the reception and clarity of my apps to my television.
438	Kchapman17	5	Google Chromecast	This was an impulse buy while at the register. Its a life saver. I told my friend about it and also my father is interested in this wonderful creation from google.
439	Annie	4	Good for no cable	Works well with tablet and t.v.. easy set up. Good product. Inexpensive.
440	BikerBoy	5	Great Product!	ChromeCast works great, and it's easy to use. Would definitely recommend!
441	kitchamp	5	Best streaming box	Compared to some of the other streaming devices, this is the easiest to use. Lot's of apps are already compatible, and works on both iOS and Android devices. Very easy to set up and easy to use.
442	Mangos	5	Works great	I owned the older version as well. I experienced occasional drop and connectivity issues. I don't see any such glitch with this new version and it provides smoother access such as YouTube.
443	Pcat	5	Easy product to use.	I would recommend this product to anyone, it's self explanatory and easy to set up.
444	Penguin	4	Works great with my Galaxy phone	Easy to install and very user friendly. Easy to hook up to different TVs in the house
445	Whatsinaname	2	Returned it	This didn't perform well with our new 4K TV. Anytime we casted, there was a noticeable change in color on screen with everyone's faces becoming very red. After trying several things, we gave up and just went back to DirecTV for our programming. Had high hopes to avoid that but this just didn't accomplish that for us. We were not willing to see a lousy picture on our brand new 4K TV.
446	Jamesters13	5	Best purchase in a while!	The Chromecast is amazing. This is my second one. I had the original one and gave it away to buy this one. Hands down a great buy!
447	WANG246	5	Easy set up	Easy to set up and nice that it now comes with an extension cable.
448	Mickey	4	great entertainment in a small package	What I really loved about this product is how simple is is to use. You just plug in the device to your tv and power with cables that are included. Download the chromecast app onto your phone. Connect the two devices and you can begin watching your favorite movies and shows from whatever apps you have on your phone. I also love how small and compact it is so it doesn't take up any room and you can easily bring it anywhere. Not to mention it also mirrors exactly what shows on your phone screen if you have an android which is pretty cool to show off to guests.
449	GMan	4	cool gadget	Its a neat little device, didn't like that I had to keep redoing the wi-fi every time I connected to a network it was already part of
450	jamie	5	Far better than the original	I like the new design. It fits the HDMI port, and powered easily. It is faster to connect, and has better recognition of the shows as we searched channels.
451	jeff	5	great features and simple to use	This was was easy to setup and great to use. I'm n taking advantage of all it's features.
452	A13XANDER	5	Everything Connected!	"Love my new Chromecast. Laptop, Tablet, Phone, Youtube, Netflix, Chrome... all casting beautifully on my big HD screen. Hardly any lag.
New model had better WiFi, too."
453	Aaron	4	Makes regular tv's into smart tv's	So far, I really enjoy this product. I am able to connect and stream movies from my phone and tablet with ease in any room in the house now. Also get to use apps and more on my nonsmart tv.
454	Melissa	5	Perfect if you don't have a smart tv	I bought the google chromecast so I can stream my videos from my samsung galaxy tab a to my tv. It works beautifully. I love having the ability to watch my videos on my tv instead of the small screen of the tablet.
455	Sony	5	Very Helpful!!	My Family out in India was so happy to use this product as this is interesting technology they enjoy it a lot.My friend requested to get one for them.
456	cyberjnke	5	Nice for the Price	Really amazing gadget for the price. Has it's limitations, esp. doesn't play a wide variety of video types but easy to work around. Now I can put a movie on my phone, go over to a friends house, plug in the Chromecast and play the HD movie on their tv. Also sweet for beaming the phone screen and sharing pictures. There's other options but this covers the bases quite well at a reasonable price.
457	wonderer23	5	Good	Serves its purpose. Good quality. Easy to use. Better than apple tv.
458	Yvonne	5	Excellent	Works if you're trying to turn a regular tv into a smart tv. I mostly use it for Netflix.
459	Vics	4	Good improvement in performance	Was unhappy with Best Buy giving me a open box item when I paid for a new one. Regarding the Chromecast, I had the generation 1 Chromecast which gets unresponsive and has to unplug to reset also mirroring chrome browser wasn't always working. The gen2 is not perfect given the processing capacity in the small dongle.
460	Mandalou3	5	Love it	I'm computer illiterate and it's easy for me to use love it its fun for the whole family!
461	Gonamp	5	great	great google chromecast to watch my pone content in my hd tv
462	speedkills	5	nice product	this product works nice with phone and tablet. real easy to use. can transfer to any machine
463	Nico26	5	Google Chrome Cast	Very happy with my purchase, it was easy to install. Good investment for the money.
464	Dnobles	5	Great Product	Love this thing, have one on every TV in my house!
465	Ritz	4	Excellent product	This is a great product. Very easy to setup. It can be even taken along while travelling.
466	smitty	5	SO easy, works great, great price!	I bought this instead of shelling out the extra bucks for the Apple TV. All I wanted was a device that I could throw my images to (i.e. phone, laptop, tablet etc.) but I did not need the extra features of the Apple TV...why overpay for something you're not going to use. This was exactly what I wanted for a fraction of the cost of the alternative!
467	CJ25	5	Great for Any TV with HDMI	Chromecast works very well with cellphones, tablets and computers on the same wifi network.
468	tagnizkur	1	use is limited	did not work for me. would not stay connected returned it.
469	jennjenn	5	Wonderful	This is my first casting device and it was a breeze to set up and use. Has the occasional hiccup where it disconnects from my device and won't pause right when I want it to, but that's about it.
470	Dakkar	4	Still exploring	Love the price & the $10 Best Buy gift card. Had some difficulty with the interface between the TV, AV receiver, & the device. I'm going to buy an HDMI extension cable to improve the signal strength & hopefully speed up the response time between the tablet & what's on the TV screen. I'll have to update my review when the cable comes and I have time to explore.
471	ArtDlP	5	Performs and looks well	Had no problem setting it up, no buffering in videos. Looks good, but I don't love that the new design makes it hang of the HDMI port.
472	User1	1	Doesn't work with slingbox	Don't buy this If you plan to use it with Slingbox. It simply does not work with it.
473	sngurban	1	Limitations for use	Does not work with regular app. It struggled to do it;s job.
474	njb09	5	Easy set up, great product	The google chromecast was extremely easy to set up on multiple devices (android phone, ipad, ipod touch) and clearly and quickly streams videos to my TV. Just make sure you have enough HDMI ports if you already use other products with HDMI cables to your TV.
475	Fxtbrkn	5	Fits my needs	We needed the ability to stream an internet browser to our TV as our didn't have the option and this fit the bill. The built in apps on the TV are OK, not great and we found Hulu buffers much less using Chromecast+iPhone. We have not exhausted all of the features, but for what we use it for, it's perfect.
476	pmcclelan	5	Easy set up	Was easy to set up. Great when your in a hotel. Would recommend.
477	Soni	5	I absolutely love it	I am glad to say that this item works perfectly, and most of all is really easy to use.
478	PatrickSmith	5	Great product	Bought this with the idea of cutting the cable of our service provider. Works very well on both IOS software and of course Andriod products. Will be cutting our service provider soon.
479	Oleanders	5	Easy to use	Easy to use and simple to setup. Have had no problems.
480	Jtbad	5	I love the chromecast	I enjoy the chromecast and have bought one for every tv in my house and my girlfriends.
481	MoDog1964	5	Chromecast is a must buy item	I went into BestBuy to purchase a set of cables for my cellphone that allowed me to view what's on my phone to my television. One of the BestBuy employees recommend the Chromecast and I'm happy he did.
482	Cyncyn	5	Works Great	DOES exactly what it was designed to do. Great product.
483	Ross	2	Not worth it	I thought this would be a better option than plugging my laptop into my tv with a hdmi cord but I was wrong. The capture is visually horrible.
484	Sabrina	5	Chromecast Delivers!	Other then having to pay for subscriptions to most of the apps Chromecast is great! My family and I love it!
485	Jkatz78	5	Upgrade from v1	Amazing for the price. Super convenient. Only down side it is gets hot.
486	Mim6ea	5	User friendly.	I was able to install this product very easily. I can watch my shows using my non-smart TV.
487	Vuong	5	Very good Chromecast 2015!	Thank you for new Chromecast 2015. This is faster and better than my older one.
488	Venky	4	Beware of interference with OTA COAX cable	"My situation is probably unique. I have a Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch TV (2008). On this TV, the HDMI and USB inputs are pretty close to the COAX antenna input. My COAX is good quality, but not top of the line. With the Chromecast plugged in, I lose channels and have streaking on the strong ones (NBC, FOX, CBS etc). I have noticed that anytime I take the Chromecast HDMI magnet near the COAX, my TV has trouble with channels. There is interference on the channels if Chromecast is powered via the TV USB.

Something for you to watch out if you experience poor OTA reception on the TV."
489	reviewer24	5	Definitely buy it	Connects to the wireless easily and holds a strong signal. Seamlessly access the apps from your laptop or phone and this product makes your life way better.
490	Davidj76	5	Great device for any age	Great product I have one for my living room as well as my bedroom, it is so convienant and easy to use
491	astansbery	4	Great	Better than the previous model. I just wish it had more functionality and I hope they get the whole PC screencast working past beta functionality.
492	sbavjratca	4	Good Product; still needs some development	The Chromecast did pretty much as advertised. I had a dumb TV and it turned it into a mostly-Smart TV. My only annoyance with it is that I haven't found a way to put files I own from my own computer through it and to the TV. For example, if you bought a video from iTunes, you could not send it from a computer/phone/tablet to the TV with the Chromecast. Otherwise, very useful for things like Netflix and YouTube.
493	lexy	5	love it	We have one of the older ones and the USB broke so I'm glad to see they improved and made it differently now.
494	MCRider99	4	Chromecast	This chromecast device does what I needed it to do. It turned my non-Smart TV into a Smart TV. I can also broadcast my entire laptop screen on the TV screen, which is a nice bonus feature.
495	Sw84	4	Great system	My only gripe is I wish you could watch anything you can access online on your tv when it's connected, but still very happy with it and definitely recommend for those that watch a lot of netflix, hulu, amazon etc
496	SwapForce	5	Geat Deal	This was a cheap and great way to turn my TV's into Smart TV's. I bought 2 of them and got back 2 $10 gift cards back. Works great. Easy to set up.
497	jetlag	5	Its a Chromecast	Second Gen Chromecast and a gift card deal all in one. Thanks Best Buy!
498	Redbolt	5	Awesome	If you don't want to make the commitment of buying a Smart TV, chromecast is the way to go
499	scarface	5	great device	works really well and I like it, I can cast from phone or pc. awesome.
500	chito	4	great for all products	This product is great because it's a device which is affordable and portable. It can be use on many devices it's not set just for one device which is great.
501	DeivitLePlazca	5	Plug-Link-enjoy	"The easiest fastest and good looking device I've had for carrying video and images from any device to my screen.
Can move from one tv to another in seconds without a haze."
502	VY2013	5	Excellent product and works well with wifi.	Great product. very handy when needed to share on a big screen.
503	OrsonicallyWells	4	Fine product, though the Fire Stick edges it out	"If you're on the fence between the Chromecast and the Fire Stick, I'd urge you to take a second look at the Fire Stick. The Chromecast is a fine piece of hardware, and it's a bit less expensive than the Fire Stick. However, the lack of a remote is disappointing. I understand Google's intent and the accessibility of smartphones/tablets as a virtual remote, but I think the interface lacks polish where it counts.

With great support and a great price, the Chromecast is a bargain, and a worthwhile upgrade for any dumb or smart TV. I'd go five stars if Google would release a $10 remote accessory for those of us wanting a clicker."
504	sniper	1	very hard to get it to connect	"Have a year old 3-D Sony Blue Ray player and could not get it to connect to Wi-Fi tried over and over with no luck. 
Finely tried the fire wire and it was no problem at all, in a matter of a min. it was connected. way better !!!!"
505	Raleigh	5	Great Product	Turned my new TV into a smart TV for $25 ($35 but got back a $10 Best Buy gift card). Very easy to use with my cellphone and tablet.
506	nblaker	4	Google Chromecast	With the Google Chromecast I am able to watch my Netflix movies on a TV in my bedroom.
507	Jason	5	Great for beginner	Prefer the Apple Airplay over the Chromecast anyday
508	tomkat6	5	amazing	my second one. I love it. its amazing and easy to use
509	colinje	5	Faster Streaming	The only advantage to this version of the Chromecast is the 5Ghz wireless capability, which inherently can transfer wirelessly at faster rates than 2.4Ghz range. This was a future-proof purchase for the inevitable 4k videos soon to be more widely available via movie and tv show web applications.
510	MattVarghese	5	Cheap Method for Streaming on TV	This is a good, cheap alternative to other streaming options such as Roku. The integration with Android devices is an added bonus. If you are an Android household this is a must-have.
511	Shaytavian	5	Awesome Streaming Product	You just cannot go wrong with a Chromecast. The biggest reason any household needs this device is to stream shows from network websites that are not available on traditional streaming services such as Hulu because of some copyright streaming restriction. Now I can enjoy all of my shows just by streaming from my computer to the TV. You just can't go wrong with a Chromecast.
512	Diego	1	Did not work to satisfaction	Had problems connecting to Netflix. Streaming programs to my TV are interrupted frequently.
513	lkt19	5	loving it	love it. cheap. make my tv become a smart tv. great product from google
514	Olivea08	3	Easy to use	Easy set up and plays everything but Amazon prime which is frustrating
515	KingBeevr	5	Simple and superb	It's small, simple and executes it's purpose flawlessly. As long as you understand what this device is actually for you will not be disappointed in it's performance.
516	iScoreGoals	5	Use it all the time	The Chromecast is a very useful item. I use it almost daily to stream Netflix from my phone on to the TV. Plenty of other uses for it.
517	mghiasi	5	Great Chromecast	I like it! I recommend it to other users; It is very compatible with cellphones and notebooks!
518	ISRALORE	5	AWESOME	I HAVE CONNECTED 2 LAPTOPS 2 CELL PHONES AND A TABLET TO OUR TV THANKS TO CHROMECAST. ME AND WY WIFE LOVE IT. 3 OF THE 5 GADGETS WE CONNECTED ARE GOOGLE PRODUCTS BUT THE OTHER 2 WORK JUST FINE WITH IT.
519	ChromeCaster	5	Easy to use and very easy to setup	Good for tablets, smartphones and laptops as long as apps support chromecast
520	Cocacola	5	Great if you don't have cable	This is great if you don't have or want cable and you want to have a variety of shows to wstch
521	dazemp	5	Works well for streaming from my computer to my tv	I bought this so I didn't have to sit in front of my computer to catch up on shows that I have missed. It works very well.
522	Naay	5	Love Chromecast!	My son talked me into getting this and I love it...works great casting missed tv shows from my chromebook.
523	MatiGG	5	Great Product	Great product with a new style. It couldn't be better to buy this
524	Igurule	5	Great device	Allows me to watch YouTube Netflix and Hulu without other bulky devices and easily connects to my phone through wifi.
525	User1	5	Great	Great. Loved it. Perfect for what I need it for!!!
526	sirbrandonrocks	5	Incredible present.	Purchased another one as a present after grabbing this one for my self. Wonderful easy to set up and use with any smart phone.
527	MysticalRose	4	good value	Very convenient and compact and a good value for what it cost.
528	GHodges	5	Great alternative to Cable	Great alternative to Cable, I recently turned in the cable box and went digital. This little device has made that transition very easy. Plus it is a lot more fun.
529	hikarate2	5	TV Communication	Very nice feature to link your tablet with your TV, setup was easy and all functions work.
530	DwelleR	5	Great Product	Easy to use. Instruction was too the point and easy as well. Love the product.
531	Pawel06	5	Smart tv	We love this! We are able to put netflix on our phone and it shows up on the tv and then able to do other things on our phone without it messing up our movie. A great way to have a smart tv without buying a new tv!
532	east2797	4	still a good product	Still a good product. I did look at the specs for the first generation and second generation but im not noticing a difference
533	SPORT	1	WAS NICE WHILE IT WORKED	It's not very good product, not the item it's self, but what the system works on. It connected once to my tv but now, nothing. It won't respond to my phone or tablet. Tried powering off the device and deleting the app and reinstalling but still nothing. It won't sync to my phone at all, and now I can't even return the device. I will try messaging the company and maybe they can send me a new one. Overall it might work for you, but it requires a stronger signal.
534	DadBear	5	"Great device to raise IQ of a ""dumb"" HDTV ""smarts"""	My early HDTV isn't very smart and the NetFlix app was no longer supported on my DVD player....economical device to add to TVs HDMI slot to receive content from my tablet.
535	Dave	4	Incremental improvement over last gen	I bought this to replace one of two older models, but so far I've seen only incremental improvement in performance. It does seem to load video faster than the original but that's about all. Expected a bit more given the new design. That said, it's still a quality streaming experience so long as you're willing to use your phone or computer as a TV remote.
536	rpared01	5	better than the 1st gen	wow is all i can say. this 2nd gen cast is much better. my old 1st gen was having rang issues but this new 2nd gen solved that with it better antennas.
537	Yadly	5	Amazing Buy	The Chromecast is way better than the apple tv. You can cast movies you search online. Im on it all the time.
538	snowshoejim	5	Works as designed. Replacing Comcast Cable Boxes	"This product works just fine for me. We have seven (7) TVs in our house and comcast is our cable provider. For years I've paid a monthly fee for each converter box. We are now down to one main xfinity X1 box.

The other TVs are hooked up to chromecast device and we stream live TV from a chromebook and macbook using the chromcast extension on google chromes browser and the xfinity TV to go website.

You can cast ALL your channels if you connect to a comcast home wifi.

Basically, the chrome + mac books replaced the the converter boxes.

Don't forget that as of 2/16/16, Best Buy is giving away a $10 gift card when you buy a chromecast device so the next is 25 VS 35"
539	ohmy5boys	5	google chromecast inexpensive and great feature	we've been using the google chromecast to stream youtube videos and our pics and videos from dropbox onto our tv screen...it is inexpensive and very easy to use
540	BenW	4	Great enhancement to my smart TV	"I was skeptical of buying Chromecast, since I already have a smart TV with a lot of the same apps on it as Chromecast. But, what I now realize is that I can cast a lot more up to my TV than what the smart TV, itself, is capable of delivering. So, this device greatly expanded the viewing options available.

One reason I did not give it 5 stars is because Chromecast still cannot seem to negotiate 5GHz wi-fi. I have to ""dumb down"" to my slower wi-fi connection. Fortunately, I have a router that can serve up multiple types of wi-fi connections. (And, I could not find any documentation on this issue, so I had to figure it out on my own.) Otherwise, I'd give this device 5 stars."
541	Rollie	5	Best buy ever	This was recommended to us by one of your sales associate telling us that his mom used it and loves it. So we tried it. Sadly, we forgot his name. We are so elated that he recommended it to us!!!! Best employee...best buy in best buy!
542	Shun	3	Sometimes it work but sometimes don't	Sometimes it work fine but sometimes I just can't connect to the internet.
543	Javier	5	Great product	It's great for watching Netflix or YouTube on your TV with your smart phone but with a computer you could cast alot of stuff.
544	CharlieGurl	5	Love this!	This is my second Chromecast. I bought it for another TV at another location. I love how easy it was to setup and use. Watching HULU via the Chromecast is like watching live TV! Love it!
545	godforgive3	5	Better than apple TV	This is much better than apple TV or Roku. All you need is a phone or tablet. Set it up
546	Keith	5	Great product	I like the Chromecast I can watch anything I want from my device's on my tv with out have a full smart TV.
547	BenCossette	4	Does one thing really well	Chromecast is a one trick pony. But it does that one trick so well. It does screen casting better than any other streaming device, which is what it's for.
548	mk6886	5	easy to install, allows us to view internet on tv	I bought this device on the advice of my brother. We installed it in minutes and voila, internet content on the big screen TV.
549	TeflonTom	5	Does what it is supposed to	Works great no complaints. Plugged it in and started streaming
550	Mshoney33	5	easy to set up and connect	I'm loving it because it's easy to set and able to connect to the tv through the app whatever movie or music video you want to see
551	Nani	1	Not too great	I expected a better product. Very disappointed that it keeps logging off!! I have exchanged it twice!
552	odie	4	Works well to watch shows .	Have purchased three so far. Son uses it in his room. We have used this to replace one of our receivers as well.
553	Sweett	4	Easy to Connect	Chromecast, is very easy to download, and it allows me to watch movies on the T.V. from the tablet,and anything else. I have recommended to a friend.
554	cwaara	5	Gets the job done	If you are looking for something to wirelessly stream to your tv this does an excellent job. Easy to set up and use too.
555	Juju	5	Great !	"It's just amazing !
My family loves it !!!
Very easy to connect and simple to use !"
556	ScottJ	4	cool gadget	I'm not a computer or electronic savvy person, but this device is simple and easy to install, watching shows I've missed out on without blinking an eye.
557	PapaBear	5	Great Product	Google keeps raising the bar. This is a easy way to cast stuff from your mobile when to your television.
558	mycroft16	5	Chromecast 2 is a great product	Incredibly easy to set up. Compact device is easy to hide behind a TV. Works very simply with minimal setup or fuss. Great for the whole family.
559	cycloneuser	4	Great Source of Entertainment	"The features of Google Chromecast make it an excellent purchase.

As a poor college student, would you like to experience the many benefits of cable without paying a monthly charge? I was in the same boat, until I purchased the Google Chromecast. With the Chromecast’s affordability, versatility, and simplicity, it satisfies all my needs for entertainment at a low price.

Affordability

Google Chromecast is available at a one time, low rate. The one time charge of the Chromecast makes it convenient and affordable for many college students. Paying a monthly charge for cable is something many college students cannot afford to do. With other monthly charges such as groceries and rent, it is difficult to pile another monthly bill on top, so using the Chromecast for entertainment is a cheap alternative. The only additional charge to the Chromecast is Wi-Fi, which is usually included in campus housing. No other charges will be needed to use the Chromecast for entertainment, making this a cheap and effective option for college students as well as anyone else looking for entertainment at a cheap rate.

Versatility

Both Apple and Android products offer a free Chromecast application in their respective “App Store”. Through this application there are suggested apps across a variety of categories. By using the many apps offered, you have the opportunity to use the Chromecast in many different ways. The most popular Chromecast categories include: TV & Movies, Music & Audio, and Sports. These applications give you the option to use your Chromecast for the common things you do on cable, such as watching sports, the news, movies, and reality TV. Along with the visual options, the Chromecast also has a wide variety of applications for audio, making it useful at parties or just for the everyday music listener.

Simplicity

The device comes with easy to follow step-by-step directions for set-up and everyday use. After initial set-up, which takes only a minute or two, it takes a click of a button in compatible apps to connect your mobile device to the Chromecast each time you use it. Along with the ease of use, the Chromecast connects to devices wirelessly. This is very useful for college students, as well as anyone whom cannot be close to a TV at all times.

All in all, the Chromecast has many benefits for someone looking for entertainment at a cheap price. It offers a variety of entertainment suitable for people of all interests and needs. Finally, the initial set-up along with everyday use is very simple. These characteristics make this product a great purchase for college students, as well as anyone else looking for a versatile entertainment product at an affordable price."
560	Lefty	5	It's a great product to mirror your tablet on TV.	"It took a bit of doing, but it was finally possible to get this Chromecast to mirror what I was doing on my Samsung Galaxy onto our TV set.

A great way to share photos from Facebook"
561	2828280	5	Have WOW and an Arris Modem?	I know this product is great but I haven't been able to use it yet. If you have Wow for your internet provider and their Arris DG2470 Modem/Router, Chromecast will not work. This was easily found using a google search after having touble trying to connect it. So, If buying Chromecast, make sure your modem is compatible. I will go tomorrow and buy a modem.
562	Tracied36	4	I like the convenience.	I dont like having to set it up every time I change tv's. But the convenience is great. I can't get Amazon prime videos but at least I can screen mirror to watch them.
563	Jon2318	5	Simple to use	This is so easy to use. It's so much fun linking Facebook accounts to it to have a slideshow of your photos on screen. Really brings back past memories. Some people think having no remote is a hassle, but I personally love using my phone as the remote.
564	Mom2Kingston	4	Cool Christmas Gift	I got this as a gift for my parents. My Mom is into gadgets. She loves that it is plug and play and connects to her tablet iphone and android phone. I prefer the apple tv box because it has its own remote in addition to airplay. But I would recommend this for a gadget lover.
565	Rvans	5	Great Product	"Great Product very easy to use and installed
Very simple"
566	jamieb38	5	Makes streaming easy	We have truly enjoyed this gadget. We are able to cast Sling TV and other such programs to our not so smart TVs. Love it.
567	Matt	4	Cromecast is a great device	Easy to use, cheaper than buying at tv for streaming feature by far. Portable , can use with all our TV's.
568	ReviewMe	5	Great way to expand entertainment experience	The Chromecast is a great device that allows streaming from any WIFI device to a TV with an HDMI input. An in home WIFI network is required for this device. Definitely recommend an AC1000 or better network to ensure buffering free viewing. The great thing about Chromecast is you don't need specially designed for this device. if you can watch it in your browser you can watch it on Chromecast.
569	jackie	2	Does not work well with Mac's	This item would be wonderful if it worked well with a mac.
570	JustHereSoIAmNotFined	5	Better than expected	Very user friendly. Much easier to use than apple TV
571	LMAS	5	Good product	I purchased this as a gift someone asked for- they are happy with the products.
572	bobbya	4	Good entry level streamer.	Easy set-up and use with many available apps. Good entry level or secondary internet streamer.
573	meme	4	Chromecast is awesome.	I love being able to stream videos from my computer without having to hook an hdmi cable up to it. I have recommended this to almost everyone I know.
574	suzie	5	Easy to install and operate	I love it, I can play Sophia the 1st all day for my 18 month old granddaughter.
575	kimeelee	5	luv it	"great if you have net flix etc. easy set up even if you are not tech savy
very happy with this purchase"
576	Elbarbary	5	As I Expected	Easy to be installed and easy to use. keep your mobile battery far from drain :)
577	Macie	5	AMAZING	This is a great product and is a much better quality than the previous model.
578	GimmeGadgets	5	Cool Shape	I've previously purchased this item as a gift and finally got one for myself. It is easy to set up and easy to use. no complaints.
579	Belly1974	5	Great for watching stuff	Got it for my kids to watch Netflix, very good product
580	AK47	5	great	the best im glad i brought the google chromecast not the other brand.
581	gmatrix730	5	Bought as a gift	Pretty sure it works or the person i bought it for would have mentioned it
582	Houppe	5	Excellent product	This item has broadened the world of home entertainment for my family. It is easy to install and use. I recommend this product.
583	Saraph	5	Great improvement over the first model!	"While the form factor isn't as nice, this model does improve on everything the first gen did in regards to speed and even some features!

Not a buy if you're still able to stream everything just fine using the first gen, but if you want the fastest possible chromecast experience this is a must!"
584	roycesa	5	Adore	We don't pay for cable or dish in my home - hulu plus and netflix only...but there are a few things we miss out on that are available online via hulu, but not on any of our televisions, so Chromecast is an AMAZING and obscenely AFFORDABLE addition! A one-time $35 payment is just absolutely ridiculously fair for how much use you get out of this powerful little thing. I'm definitely going to be getting another one of these for another one of my TVs asap, as it works flawlessly, and is completely wonderful.
585	Thehelpfulogre	5	Great for mirroring from phone to the tv	I bought this to stream Netflix and YouTube but found myself mirroring my phone to the tv and have a giant phone.
586	TVcritic	4	Chromecast 2015	"Pros: It has good speed and processor. Some apps connect quickly some does not. Good price. Very compact and easy st up.
Cons: Limitation on usage compared to Roku 3. Roku has most of the features but higher price.
I still prefer Roku 3 for my usage compared to chromecast"
587	Fivefoot1shorty	5	Best thing ever!	This little plug in helps transform my original TV. I can screencast right fromy phone and use other apps with it. Plugs into a small HDMI port in your TV, and hooks to WiFi with ease.
588	Chromecast	5	Any TV will be smart TV	Works great and is compatible with any TV and good apps for steaming
589	doubledown21	5	New Google Chromecast	I purchased this second Chromecast as it was a better fit for my one TV what has a narrow HDMI port, which my first Chromecast had a hard time fitting into when other things were plugged in. Compared to other devices, it is inexpensive and efficient for what I need.
590	dnr2517	4	great cable alternative	Easy to install. Gives wide choices of programming to view. Helps you cut the cord (cable).
591	loviedovie7492	5	Great Product!	Bought this for a friend for Christmas, and they absolutely loved it! It came it great timing, and they use it every day! Highly recommend!
592	Kendall	5	Useful & portable	Great product for a great price! It comes in handy for streaming from any device
593	Movies	4	Item as advertized in store	Purchased for my mother. She loves it, Able to get most her shows
594	MattT	5	Works great!	Google Chromecast works great for anyone that wants to watch netflix, hulu, or other streaming services right from their TV.
595	Tomi	3	Love it but...	"Great since as I get older my smartphone and tablets become harder to see. More and more apps are becoming chromecast friendly (except Amazon prime videos, grrrr)
The biggest problem is that Chromcast has a known defect that it will occasionally lose all sound. The resolution according to support is to reset app, reset chromecast, reconfigure chromecast, change ports, and in general just play around until it works again Very frustrating."
596	buffaloposter	5	So easy even stupid people can use	I am not good with tech but this was really easy to set up and use and I love being able to stream stuff to my tvs so economically.
597	Jay1	4	Good	Its a good product and very easy to use. I would recommend it to a friend.
598	Daddio	4	Simplicity is king	No fumbling around. Parents figured this out at age 80.
599	MyBrowskie	4	Chromecast Offers More Than Expected	All the content partners like Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, and Google Play Music + many more are there , but this device still does more than just play video from faraway servers. I found out i can actually display my own videos and photos on my devices running iOS and Android. It only took an install of Google Photos app and even if my photos weren't uploaded they'd play on my TV amazingly quick. In addition to that some websites let me cast content without requiring that i download an app. The media dongle streams content with an impressive response since it uses the new wireless AC standard and having an AC compatible router, the stuff i want to watch loads plenty fast. I keep a focus on the speed because i wasnt expectng it. I only wish you could opt at what quality video streams because i dont known if it 720p or 1080p. Oh and the Chromecast app is worth a download because it gives out a ton of Offers. I got Sling Tv for 3 months trial! Stuff like that, and YouTube red for 3 months free to. Im happy with the purchase, i also wish Best Buy sold it in the various colors Google does on their website. I wont lie though, my heart is still with my Apple Tv.
600	Mcannone	4	Nice product	Didn't realize it required the app to run on your device (phone or tablet, therefore using their batteries) and then mirrored on tv thru Chromecast. But overall really nice and easy-to-handle device.
601	Dano	3	Doesn't do what I bought it for....	In case you were wondering if it will stream NFL Mobile that you get with Cell service, it doesn't.
602	mnrider	5	Love Chromecast for streaming to the TV	We have a chromecast for multiple TV's now because they are so easy to stream netflix or hulu to the TV.
603	science143	5	Great Item	I bought two of these when they were 2 for 50 dollars and I am glad I did. I owned one of the first generation models and I think this model is a bit faster than the first one. I have a 5.4 GHz/ 2. 4 GHz dual band router and I do enjoy this model as it allows me to take advantage of that. Be aware though that your setup device has to be able to connect to whatever network or bandwidth that you want to use, so I had to borrow my sister's Galaxy S5, but it was worth it. I definitely recommend this item.
604	BudB	5	Amazing technology	If you're looking for a steaming device with a system of menus, that's not the Chromecast, but if you are looking for the freedom to play just about anything from your phone to your TV, this works amazingly well including websites. Also very low battery usage on my Samsung Galaxy S5.
605	auntie	5	Chrome cast	I bought it as a gift for my niece for Christmas...she's happy...
606	utrabbit	4	very cool gadget	"Just started using this so take that into account. Just to be clear, the apps are not run on this device itself, the apps are run on your device (phone/ tablet/ computer) and then streamed to the tv.
This ends up being great on certain apps - if they specify the app as being able to be ""cast"" to the tv (which most of the major video apps are), it does great because your device ends up just starting the connection and acting as the controller and the heavy lifting of the streaming is then done directly from the router/ modem to the tv (very little resources utilized on your device). The only downside is if the app is not listed then you are left with screen mirroring, which can still work, but can potentially suffer greatly in lag/ quality because the signal is then being produced by your device, then sent from your device to the router then relayed back to the tv. This puts a huge computing load (and battery drain) on your device. However for only $30 it is well worth the value."
607	Wakeless	5	Great product for what it's worth	I mainly use this chromecast to screen mirror my tablet to the tv. It works great! I have movies on my tablet that I can watch on my tv wirelessly. Would definitely recommend getting this
608	hallstopher	5	Everything I Was Expecting	Got this to avoid buying a cable to hook my phone up to the TV. So far it works great. I have not experienced any lag and the picture is spot on perfect. Works perfectly with my Samsung s5 and my iPad mini. Only downside is Chromecast app will not cast screen from iOS.
609	Jcruisin	4	It's small and easy to install.	Weeding through the You tube info is a time consuming trial and error process for this 74 year old. My 20 year old daughter almost got it running with our big smart screen tv. I wanted this for another hdtv that is not a smart screen. I have been told I will be able to play my videos through the cromecast with more formats available
610	Puzikov	5	Easy way to watch your shows!	"For years I was accustomed to the tablet tv life. You see, I'm pretty monetarily conscious and tablets have all these wonderful apps where I can watch a show from their dedicated app or website if I missed it the day before. Then I bought the chromecast. At first I dabbled with it, seeing that I could stream Netflix or Spotify onto it with ease as they have dedicated chromecast apps. And then one day I discovered the true potential. You see, my TV isn't what they in the biz call ""smart."" I own a dumb TV and it does me proud. But the chromecast shot new life into it through my laptop. My laptop, not nearly as cool as my iPad and a quarter as flashy, runs Google Chrome. Chrome has a chromecast extension (AKA browser app) that lets you cast exactly everything on your screen or window. That's right folks, every single thing you can stream on the interwebs right there on your big screen, regardless of your TV's intellect! Suddenly I could stream off any website I chose. The revelation allowed me to cut cable out of my life, saving over 100 dollars a month, just like that. Well, canceling cable is a tale in and of itself but I digress. The chromecast has allowed me a digital freedom that no apple tv, roku or sling tv could ever allow. As I'm sure you can tell by now, I love my Chromecast; and if you get one, I know you'll love yours too."
611	BBAH	1	Better options out there.	Comes with no instructions. The app isn't the easiest to figure out and doesn't have options like Amazon video. Not worth the buy to me. Go with roku.
612	IMHO78	5	Great streaming device	"Bought for my nephews in foreign state. Workinbg perfectly.
Can be used as with Chromecast app and other casting apps in the market.
Difference with old version is basically ability to use dual frequency."
613	robbyshmurda	5	amazing streaming device	My girlfriend and I love our Google Chromecast! It turned every television in the house into a smart t.v! Now we netflix and chill in the bedroom!
614	RayL001	5	Great device to stream media	This is a great device, I upgraded from the first version due to the poor signal but with this new version I can configure it to my AC wireless network and pickup a stronger signal.
615	Mike	5	Great product	This is a great product, set up was fast an easy I have had no problems to date.
616	MSK1	4	works as expected	I bought 3 of these. 2 for friends and one for myself. They all work well. Can share/stream from my laptop (need to have Chrome browser) or android smartphone.
617	Dgowda	5	great	The Google Chromecast is a dirt-cheap wireless video dongle that streams Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, HBO Now and thousands of other apps and games to your TV using an Android or Apple phone or tablet, or a PC, as the controller.
618	QueenCityGal	5	"Great for using with a Samsung ""DUMB"" TV"	"Have a SAMSUNG SMART TV that used to be able to mirror with phone both ways - from SAMSUNG SMART Phone to SAMSUNG TV and vice versa. This year, Samsung has royally screwed up their SmartView app and capability to mirror! (Lots of customer complaints online! The Samsung Smart TV built in Web Browser is a sad JOKE !) After many days and nights wasting hour upon hour screwing with the Samsung cr@p apps and my expensive Samsung ""Smart"" TV, I decided to try a Google Chromecast device. And without much setup effort it works very well mirroring my Samsung smart phone to my Samsung ""DUMB"" and expensive TV.

I use the Google Chromecast V4.3 app, and its ""Cast screen / audio"" feature, on my Samsung SIII smart phone which is running Android 4.4.2. (FYI: This does not work with my Samsung TAB 3 running Android 4.2.2, must be running Android 4.4.2 or later. Still trying to get my Samsung TAB3 upgraded to Android V4.4.2 - more wasted time!)"
619	OMAR107	5	cant go wrong with chromecast	I have a chromebook, android tablet, and an iphone6s. And they all can cominicate with the chrome cast no problem.
620	VictorArthur	5	A must have	Super easy to use and it's compatible with Android and IOS. The best so far
621	Iowabbfan	5	Great for streaming	Bought the Chromecast to stream Netflix to our TV instead of having premium service via Mediacom. Works great and picture is awesome!
622	Mike	2	Not what I wanted	I have to say I've not really used it. I thought it allowed you to watch whatever media from your phone, tablet, computer, whatever. I hate Google Chrome as a browser, don't want to use it. I'd rather use a15ft HDMI to micro HDMI cable and plug my tablet or laptop in, use my TV as the screen for ANYTHING
623	William	5	Best media streamer on the market	"For $35 you can't get any better then this. Easy to use, works with Android or Apple devices (or your browser on your computer). Always getting better from updates and new products adding support for it.

Get it."
624	GadgetGirl	4	Economical	Great streaming device but sometimes freezes up or wi-fi unable to locate. Otherwise works as expected. Great buy at reasonable price.
625	David	5	As described	Works best when you don't have smart TV, unlike some smart TV where it just mirrors you phone which means you will drain phone battery fast
626	alanb347	5	An Affordable Solution	I purchased my Chromecast to go with my new Toshiba television, which did not have smart tv capabilities. Set-up is simple and it is simple to use, I would recommend this device to any customer who currently uses an Android phone.
627	sweetheart	4	Great Buy	This is a great buy for those who want to keep up with technology.
628	Swype	5	Very Good Upgrade	This is a very good upgrade from the original in large part because of the new AC compatibility (5G) coverage. The 5G coverage will give this device a better wireless signal. Both router and device need 5G compatibility to use 5G, otherwise you can still use this on standard 2G coverage.
629	Jimmy	5	Love it	We use this in the living room and as long as it connects to the internet it works excellent.
630	Clicker257	5	Love it	As an android user I find Chromecast to be a great product, Easy to cast from phone, tablet or PC
631	ChrisfromCarson	4	Cute Gadget	Bought this as a gift... Best way to stream games and apps from device to TV..
632	gwg50	4	good	Easy to set up and use. Small and not in the way.....
633	KrishnamoorthyJ	5	Chromecast	Its working good. I did not see much difference between older version and newer version. Both seems to be working at the same speed and quality.
634	Scott	5	Great device	This is great for those without a smart tv or gaming console. Really easy to set up and allows you to use your laptop with your tv to surf the internet. Some lag issues will occur depending on your wireless set up. Another plus is that you can bring it with you when you travel and use it wherever you go provided there's a tv with an HDMI port and wireless connectivity.
635	Jose	5	Excellent Media Streaming Device	I had previously owned the first generation chromecast and this one is by far better. It has dual band antennas plus it does support 5.1 surround sound on certain apps like netflix and hulu.
636	KOLIO	5	Excellent Stocking Stuffer	"For those who like to share pics/videos/etc.... this is perfect.
View on your TV set instead of passing your phone/tablet around.
No household should be without a Chromecast."
637	ILOVEGADGETS	4	Not the best but the best value	With the current chromecast promos you can't go wrong.
638	J34nn3	4	Good for basic	"We purchased HDTV for the first time in July 2015, (yes I just wanted to see my korean drama in big screen) and I noticed that it is compatible with Netflix, Youtube, Viki and Dramafever. It is very simple to use and easy to sync. I'd recommend for chromecst for basic user.
Sometimes, if your wifi is out of range, you just need to reset the chromecast and plug it to nearest tv that picks up the wifi signal in hot spot area, then piug back in to the first tv. It should do the trick."
639	Jamie	5	Great addition to my home theater	I love being able to cast Youtube and Spotify to my TV in a moments notice. Works seamlessly and setup is easy. Luckily my receiver has a usb power output so I didnt need to run a power cable to an outlet!
640	Lou2015	5	Great value for the price.	A very cheap device you can use to stream Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, and thousands of other apps and game to your TV using your Android, iPhone, tablet or computer. Its small size hides conveniently behind your TV and you can take with you when traveling. The old version didn't have it but this one adds compatibility with 5Ghz Wifi networks. Very satisfied with the product.
641	someguy	5	Love it	Perfect streaming device very easy to use and set up.
642	Mystery	5	Best streaming device at cheap price !!!	This new model works great regarding speed , audio and video quality. Now no wait for buffering. Unlike other expansive streaming devices this device is at very good price. I would say it's absolutely amazing.
643	Justin	5	Better than most smart TVs	The problem with smart TV's is they tend to lag far behind the feature set bar compared to tablets/phones/etc. Chromecast lets you use your newest devices on your TV! And unlike apple TV, it works well on apple, android, AND PC devices.
644	Konson	5	Great product	This product is excellent. The quality is good. I like it very much.
645	Helenahren	5	Easy to install	The setup was relatively easy. It worked right away.
646	Bond	5	New version-Works Perfect	I was owning the 2.5 Ghz device before I bought this and it used to have few minor lags casting HD videos but this device having higher range helps my video stream faster and smoother. Perfect for HD video casting.
647	Hutch	5	Great	The new Google Chromecast is a must have. Easy to hook up.
648	BlueShirt	5	Best streaming device	Cheapest streaming device out there and the best too
649	BBshopper	5	Converted my non-smart TV to smart TV	I need to have youtube on my non-smart TV. This product get this job done for me. WIfi signal is very good and fast with this new gen.
650	Vol4Life	5	Great product for a tight budget	This is my 3rd Chromecast purchase. They are now installed on all flat screens in my home. If you're trying to decide which streamer to get, spend $35 for Chromecast and save some $$$. I can stream all media from my Apple and Android devices. Very easy to set up. No issues to report.
651	Skitzy	5	Haven't had any issues	It's the same to me as the older model. I see no difference at all.
652	criticsbuyer	4	Affordable compare to Apple TV	Only knock is not alot apps that you can cast to tv. And can't cast videos from Chrome on iOS. Need to download another app for it.
653	MDub360	5	Definitely worth the money...	"Works great with my tablet, phone, and all my screen sharing apps. It seems a little weird that the cable is so short; the Chromecast sort of dangles down, but it isn't so heavy that it ever comes unplugged. Would ""look"" better if the cable was about 2 feet and it could sit in the tv or stand."
654	Krish	5	Nice Gadget for my LCD TV	I was feeling that my TV was not Smart and with this Gadget it is a SMART TV now. Thanks Best Buy and Google
655	Adamant3	4	Easy to use and connect	The new chromecast is basically the same as the last but easier to tv with new sleek design and supposed to have better connectivity but haven't noticed much different compared to the old version. It is nice to be able to toggle between 2 different devices in different rooms.
656	neeo	5	streams my google play movies and TV to big screen	"I was watching movies and TV on my Samsung 5"" screen but this device lets me watch them on my full size TV screen. Note: you can power the device with a USB cable if your TV has a spare USB socket thus avoiding another wall brick,"
657	OgGamer	5	Love it..	I love the google chromecast as everyone in the house can broadcast media on it from their phones, ipads, and computers which is so much more convenient then having to connect and disconnect wires..
658	VetTech28	5	Works great!	"Works great, very easy to use. My son got it all set up and now I can ""cast"" whenever I want."
659	AnneA	3	Could benefit from a remote	Unlike the Fire TV stick, Chromecast does't come with a remote. This means that all interactions must be done through a phone of computer. That's OK in most cases but your phone may be charging at night and not available to watch TV.
660	tengesser	5	Works great	Works great-better than paying for cable. Easy to use.
661	QueRiddle	5	Cable what?	This is even better than the first Chromecast. I love how easy it is to cast from any device. Must buy for your television.
662	Phil	5	Cant go wrong with a chromecast	Summary says it all... if you have WIFI, a smart phone, and tv with hdmi input, you are in business. It has allowed me to go cable free.
663	Chromecastuser	5	It does what it says	Google Chromecast does exactly what it says. It works perfectly with chromecast compatible apps and chrome tabs. You can watch movies with 1080P without any freezing. Desktop mirroring can be improved more.
664	Heidisman	5	Great device for streaming!	I had no problems setting this up and matter of fact it took less than 5 minutes to install and get started! I was very impressed with the setup process and it does what it's designed to do! I do wish it worked with itunes videos but I understand why as Apple has there own player, Apple TV.
665	RB614	1	LAG	Great for Pictures. When streaming video from the phone or Laptop even, The video lags terribly. I bought this so I could stream the shows from my cellphone so i don't need my laptop hooked up all the time. I was incredibly disappointed with Chromecast!
666	Ron2000	4	Good product, tricky Setup	"I went for the deal, 2 for 50 from best buy cyberMonday online. Setting up chromecast2 was tricky.
I tried initially to set it up using my laptop and failed miserably. As per online doc; I had to upgrade to latest firmware to my router tp-link841N.
Which I did but could not connect to the chromecast2. My 2 Tv’s are Philips and Sharp LCD. So tv’s was not an issue as it showed the chromecast2 code on screen.
Thought initially it was router that is incompatible.
So reset everything to factory setting, opened up security to basic without password, mac filtering off, AP isolation off, UPNP enabled. still it was not connecting to router.
I have iPhone5 iOS 9.1. Thought I would give it a last try after 2 days of trying, with iPhone5 this time. Downloaded chromecast app from appstore. And lo and behold, it worked seamlessly.
I could connect to the network. After that I downloaded cast apps and I could cast it to the tv. I tried with laptop after downloading chromecast plugin to Chrome browser on the laptop and that too worked.
So the lesson learned here is to setup Chromecast2 with iPhone/Android. I tried one device so far and it works.
Will try the 2nd I bought over the weekend. Hope my review helps others in setting up their device.
Cheers!!!!"
667	liperus	5	Still the best streaming dongle around	The original Google Chromecast was a revolutionary device that changed how people used their TVs. This updated version of the dongle only improves on its predecessor. It has 5GHz Wifi connectivity (802.11ac) for faster streaming and seamless connections. With more and more apps being cast-enabled, the chromecast is absolutely worth the purchase at this point.
668	dtreida11	4	Great Upgrade	I feel like I get better speeds with this newer model. Thanks.
669	Cmperez	4	great computer connection	I really love the fact that I can stream movies from my computer to my tv without using a hdmi cord.
670	Lisa	5	Love Chromecast	I am mostly likely behind the times. But this device is awesome. I love you can down load movies and then take the device with you like on vacation and be able to watch those movies you downloaded. I aslo bought one for my daughter and she loves it.
671	DeeTee	5	great!!	Great product and better than the previous version,must have!
672	Jfields34	5	Great!	I had the orignial Chromecast and used it daily on a TV that isn't hooked up to cable, so upgrading was a no brainer! I have had less connection probelms with this one, and I am very satisfied with it. In the future, it would be great if it was compatible with Amazon Prime Video.
673	LGG2Rocks	5	Wish I had gotten it sooner	"Chromecast is the best way to watch internet on your TV. No need to nafigate smart TV menus. Simply select the source then use your phone or PC to ""cast"" the content you want to watch to the TV. Works great for Netflix, youtube, and countless other sources. I'm buying more!"
674	CRAZYISH	5	BEST DEVICE EVER!	The chromecast lets me stream all my content from my phone laptop or tablet effortlessly. The chromecast is probably the easiest device i have ever used to stream media. It also is not too expensive.
675	Frankie	5	Bruhh so amazing	Absolutely amazing loved it it's so easy to use and is so convient .
676	Scarycarey	3	Streams great..	Didn't have the previous version of Chromecast so nothing to compare it to but it streams great, stays connected & I can use my unlimited data to mirror from phone...yay!
677	Reggaevibez	3	Chromecast	Great product for those who choose to seek out the alternatives to cable.
678	Hans	4	Sleek and nice. Good product.	Very sleek and nice looking. Worth the money. The need to connect to an external power source one of the Cons.
679	Mofya	5	Works great!	Much improved connectivity when casting from my phone and from the chrome browser. Worth it!
680	RD79	5	Awesome	My daughter loves Chromecast. I'm actually going to purchase another one.
681	poprawks	5	Great - A bit better than the original	I got the new Chromecast for my television and gave the old one to a relative to use. Using the new one I immediately noticed there is less of a lag at the start of streaming. With the old model I would get a few seconds of frozen video with the audio going before the video caught up. That has yet to happen. Only downfall is the design. The old one shot straight out while this one dangles off the back of my TV. Not a deal breaker though.
682	Jehag47	5	Works great	I have two other Chromecasts and wanted one for a third TV.
683	TroubledJuan	4	Great Little Device	"Bought this since I don't want cable, found and connected to my wifi, and my iPhone and Android phone and tablet,
I like the way it casts from my devices and be controlled by the device I am using. Hulu, Crackle, Netflixs, youTube and more.. with out costing extra."
684	Je7t	5	Amazing	I love this product. It works great with my phone :)
685	leavion	4	Great for streaming from phone, tablet, computer	I am using the Chromecast since the 1st model came out and I purchased the 2nd generation because of it added support for 5GHz WIFI. It makes it extremely easy to stream from my Android phone, tablet and from my computer. More and more sites now support streaming from the web directly to the Chromecast, Netflix is a prime example. You can also cast a Chrome browser tab to your TV. The 2nd generation is easier to connect due to a longer connector.
686	Jamdez	5	Good streaming device	Use it with samsung s5 to stream. Works great with sling TV and crunchyroll.
687	lilmomma11	5	Love it!	My friend suggested this and I'm glad I did. Pulls a lot of Internet, have to turn wifi off on phones while streaming.
688	Vans58	5	must have product	I don't have 1st version of it. this is my first chromecastdevice and I really loved it. streaming photos as back end is really good. screen casting from my nexus 5x, and also laptop working great.
689	luke17	5	Seamless operation	My Chromecast works great. Now I can watch my team's college basketball games in HD on my TV when they are on ESPN3 or SECN+.
690	Sandmaster	5	Great improvement over 1st gen	"I have the 1st gen Chromecast and it did a job well done when it was needed. The 2nd gen improves quite a bit.
The picture quality improved due to the hardware upgrades and no lag when streaming. 5ghz was a welcome addition."
691	memes	5	great device	I have old chormecast, but this looks nicer, still not sure what is the differences but I'm ok with this
692	nugget420	5	great for casting from phone to tv	awesome works great no problems great for casting from phone to tv I use it a lot and it hasn't let me down yet
693	Bryanssurfer	5	Great product	It works flawlessly everything I expected. Just wish I could cast my iPhone screen to it
694	Robb550	5	My 2nd Chromcast	First chromecast was a Christmas gift which I love and use on the TV in the family room. Decided to buy a second one so I can stream video from my bedroom TV. A year ago I didn'tn't even know what a chromecast was now I have 2 and couldn't live without them.
695	samsung	2	not that useful	I was hoping that I could use this device in lieu of my apple TV. It has little of the functionality of apple TV and was not able stream things like Amazon easily. The whole set up process was unwieldy and temperamental
696	jagiwv	5	Great Complement to computer videos	This new version of Chromecast is worth the upgrade as the dual band wireless significantly improves streaming in crowded wireless homes. It has eliminated video dropouts and pixeling.
697	Quint	5	Still easy to use, improved with extra band	There isn't much to say, but it works. It took some tweaking to get it going on the 5Ghz band, but it works perfectly.
698	JerryW	4	Cool Design -- Loads of Fun Content	Chromecast is very easy to install. Looks slick. Works well -- speedy and access to a lot of digital content.
699	Summitjg	4	chrome cast	pretty straightforward..its google, its chrome, and it casts
700	Bdc1314	5	Very easy to use	I enjoy how easy it is for me to use the device. Just connect and it's on.
701	GeorgeB	5	Great Product	This is a great product especially for the cost. Have two now and not the first problem.
702	Tiaquette75	5	Works awesome!	Just what I needed to turn my HD flat screen tv into a smart tv!
703	Yogig	5	Love it	I recommend this item to anyone interested. This the best one so far. Every one i show it to wants one . So many options. I fav is downloading movies to my phone and streaming them to the chromecast. You can send music and photos its wonderful. God bess Google for this.
704	Bookworm	5	Works Great	We liked the first gen so well that we donated that one to our church and bought the 2nd gen for us!
705	MrKyle	5	Made my older Samsung LED TV Smart	The Chromecast has worked well with my android tablet. I've tried Netflix, HBOnow, YouTube and Google Play movies and they all connect with no issues. Looking forward to trying more streaming apps when they become available.
706	amerninja380	5	Nice update	"First of all, for people who already have a Chromecast, there's not much to see here. Aside from compatibility with 802.11 AC, there's really no added functionality. That can really make a difference though, especially if you already have a lot of devices on your network. Since I got it, I haven't noticed any buffering or seen it slip into SD.
I really like the interface, which is run entirely through your cellphone, but it's not going to be for everyone. Very simple and easy to use, but if you want a remote, you're better off going with something like a Roku"
707	iowacx	5	Easy to use	I have the older version of this and this one is much easier to plug into the TV
708	Billyboy13	4	Great device, simple hook up	This device is simple and easy hook up. Easy to use and very convenient. I'm a simple guy with very little knowledge of today's technology and I found this device very easy to use.
709	Technophile	5	Great little device, we used the 1st Gen one...	everyday. The newest iteration is even better with enhanced bitrate and speed support with wireless 802.11 ac support, loving this device to stream between rooms in the house.
710	Techengine8	5	Great revision of Chromecast.	I bought the original Comcast and loved it. The revision is even better especially with it being able to connect to my 5Ghz wifi wireless channel streaming video at full 1080p HD. I would definitely recommend it :)
711	james25	5	totally better then i though it be	I hook up to my flat screen tv then add it to the extensions of my computer browser.. I add app to my cell phone to get to work from there. It will take some time to get the hang of it but once you get it you will love it...
712	Donn248	5	mirrors laptop to tv	This product worked good once I discovered that there was a software update that was not described in the set up. When downloading extension you have to download beta version to get the updated version and to complete set up. If you do not download beta version you will get error message that there is a new updated version.
713	FamilyFun	5	Easy Set-Up and Kids Love It	the set-up was a breeze and my kids love it. great product!
714	lablover	5	great product	have enjoyed using my chromecast since the day it was delivered, setup could not have been any easier. would recommend to anyone looking to stream from a mobile device to a t.v.
715	taurus	5	no complaints	i love how I can download an app and link it to the cast with just one touch of the cast icon
716	Momov2	5	Great device	Easy to set up with apple iphone6. No breaks in streaming.
717	JaysonHaneds	5	Love the Chromecast!	There's literally nothing to not love about this device! It works flawlessly and is used everyday in our home.
718	Santosh	5	Seamless and Good update	I like the design of this item and its easy to configure and use.
719	ce303	4	Good Buy	So far so good. It is faster and a better connection that the first one.
720	Jmprest	5	Just like the original	Only with better WiFi, faster connections and future features totally worth it
721	KB112	5	2015 Chromecast still the best bang for your buck	"Having had the prior model Chromecast I didn't expect much different. Aside from the new puck shape and hanging connectors, functionality is the same. The enhanced antennas and speeds are a plus.

Bang for the buck it's my favorite media streamer. It's simple to use for my children, youngest is 4, and my elderly in laws. Set up is simple and then you just open your commonly used Chromecast enabled apps, connect and cast. Doesn't get much simpler. A definite buy for $35, can't really go wrong."
722	casegrad91	4	Incremental improvement over previous model	With the attached HDMI extension cable, the 2015 Chromecast is a little easier to position behind the set. Wireless performance seems more stable. I haven't seen any freezes or hiccups yet.
723	sw99	5	Better than the original in so many ways	"Purchased this as a replacement for my previous Chromcast v1. This is a worthwhile upgrade for the price $35!

Some of the new benefits:
1. Now supports 5Ghz wireless
2. much improved wireless dongle for connecting to a TV mounted flush with the wall. The old one was stiff - Note: You can use your old extended if you need even more room
3. casting is much faster

I'm sure there are other great features, but these are the ones that were important to me"
724	Stupendoussteve	5	Same behavior, better performance	This new Chromecast is familiar for users of the previous model, but has a better and faster connection and overall better performance. It is worth an upgrade.
725	Jimker55	5	works great	Chrome cast works as it should. very easy to set up and haven't had any problems!
726	Frank	4	Good but google has a few bugs to workout	Got this to upgrade from older model. Unable to connect 5ghz on wireless AC unless i disable all password on the access point wireless. This is a router using stock firmware. Google is aware of bug.
727	Abe65jet	5	Best for your money	This Did what I needed it to do. And google lived up to the 5 G wireless network promise. Works well.
728	Jessz77	5	Chromecast	We have a couple of the older models so when we saw that there was a newer version we jumped at it. So far it works great. Less time buffering or waiting. Not bad for the price either.

I would not have purchased it. I didn't test it right away now I'm stuck with it. Don't like the fact that I can only use Google Apps."
736	Mubi	5	Perfect for my use	Perfect for my use. I love this product , so easy to use.
737	vtk09	4	Works as expected	Everything works as expected. The only downside is it does not come with a wall plug-in and the USB plug-in is not the best option.

748	JURZGURL	5	Good	Tje item worked for what i needed it fir with mo problems.

767	Lance	5	Makes my TV smart	The Google Chromecast can basically make your TV smart. With your smartphone (works with either Android or iOS), you can access apps like Netflix, HBO NOW, Showtime to watch your favorite shows, or even cast Facebook videos. I like the Chromecast because I can specifically cast videos when I use my phone's internet browser. Very helpful when you want something on a bigger screen rather than on a small screen.
768	MRD33	5	Really cool	This is a really cool way of playing youtube or other streaming videos on your TV screen. It is really easy to use too.
769	Cabal	4	Convenient	This item makes it easy to watch stuff on any TV with either a PC or smartphone. I would think Google has enough moola to make it cheaper to buy though.

771	crog75	5	Nice!	This is a neat little device. Easy to set up and use, nice price point. I wish a few more of the apps I used would Cast, but that is not a fault of the device.

777	Raph	5	Great Item for different uses	I have used Chromecast extensively: Cast videos and photos from my phone, project work presentation, cast music, play games, etc. This fellow is useful if you need to move it around the house, taken that is pretty light and small. Very reliable product as well.

779	LerKes76	3	Google Chrome cast	This chrome cast work great if u don't have a smart tv.
780	paul1235	4	Better design	In standby it shows static pictures as screen saver, the new flexible cable attachment won't be easily destroyed by pets. For most people, 1080p resolution is still the standard and this does a very good job with that resolution.
781	ayesha69	5	easy setup	fast and easy setup easy to use with clear every thing
782	Crash	5	Makes internet accessibility easier	Our internet provider recently upgraded our service with 100mb fiber optic service. Our adult son suggested purchasing the Google Chromecast for ease of internet accessibility.

787	Craig	5	Excellent way to stream your favorite shows	Device is very easy to install, is hidden from view of the TV so no cords, etc are visible. Great product!
788	dayah	5	Great TV Caster from Any Device	"This is an amazing TV casting (streaming) product for $30. I have iOS & Android devices (oh, and Chrome on PCs) that can ""project"" to the large screen TV. Most mobile apps (eg. Netflix, ) have adopted Chromecast as their supported casting feature. Here is a link of supported apps... https://www.techradar.com/news/television/13-best-chromecast-apps-for-google-s-streaming-stick-1302646"
789	Roro713	5	Great way to watch Netflix	With no cable Chromecast provides use with Netflix and other apps i really like Chromecast
790	Fredster	5	Easy to use....	I was skeptical that it would deliver as promised. I am definitely not disappointed! My wife uses it daily for morning workouts with no glitches....highly recommend!
791	awood	4	Great product. Not perfect but does the job well.	It works very well and is easy to set up. I had some misunderstandings about it’s functionality, but it still does plenty to make life convenient. For example, I thought I would be able to cast my laptop screen as if it were a wireless hdmi connection, but it can only mirror a single google chrome tab at a time, and it’s quite laggy at that. I also find it strange that the device has to always be plugged in to external power. I thought it would draw power from being plugged into the tv, but you either have to plug it into a wall outlet or plug the usb into the tv. Other than those misunderstandings on my behalf, I do still enjoy it’s hd streaming capability and convenient wireless control from my phone!
792	Nick	5	Great addition	"Allows Hulu to mirror wirelessly on any tv
From iPhone, iPad, etc"
793	Cali	4	A great product	Great if you don't have a smart tv or want to view on a bigger screen

796	Cuata	4	Good device	I do not know if it would be good to have it connected to the electric current.
797	Highdez	5	Awsome	Highly recommended if you have a older flat screen...
798	DannyH	5	Exactly what was advertised	I was looking for a Chromecast for my older flat screen, and this one fit the bill exactly.
799	bubba2233	5	2nd one I purchased	"I purchased the 1st one for my 26 yr old son because he would watch wrestling on Utube on his Laptop now he can cast to his 50"" plasma TV. He also casts Amazon Prime video. He loves it. The second one was for my daughter. She is not as excited about it."
800	Leadman311	4	Very reliable	I like this units to cast my phone o my tv's, easy to use
801	Piru	5	Excelent	I had bought many of this devices in BB. Always with excelent results
802	EclecticMo	4	Great device for the price	"Great performing streaming device that was easy to set up - 5 mins or less. After a couple minutes of installing updates, it was ready! Casting worked easily from both my phone and laptop.
The only downside is that there is no inbuilt ""app"" to browse and play (like Roku has). But gives it's super affordable price point, it's not too big of a deal."
803	Earl	5	Excellent product that works well	Despite my very minimal wifi service. the Chromcast that I bought at Best Buy has delivered excellent video from both my Iphone and my laptop computer. Initially, I had purchased another product from another source that claimed to be a Chromecast device, but was in reality a fake and did not work at all. Beware of this product! Make sure you have a real one which can be purchased at Best Buy.
804	Mads070707	5	Easy to installing	Easy to install and works without any problems....

811	captainwolfe	4	works well but devices that it works with are limi	I followed all directions and they were simple to set up, i found that streaming works very well but only from some devices, it streams well from android devices like my phone and tablet, but will not stream from my lenova 2 in one laptop that is only 3 months old, it also wont stream from my 2 month old samsung chrome laptop.
812	Mack	4	Plenty of apps to choose from	Better than paying hundreds of dollars a month for cable

823	rxrodriguez81	4	Great	Great. Love it. Best thing I have ever ever bought.
824	GLW73	4	This takes some getting used to	I got this to use YouTubeTV and it takes some practice when switching from cable. I'm sure I'll eventually think it's easy maybe even easier.

It was recommended to me. Excellent product! Must have!"
834	NcMom	5	Easy setup, breeze to use	Leave it to Google to keep things simple. Download app, plug in device, click here, click there and, boom, you're in business. Really like the cast for casting computer screen as well as content off of phones and tablets. Have Roku in addition to Chromecast and can use them both.
835	trevor	4	Good product	It works as intended. Not really much to say here. Ok
836	Elvin	5	Pretty Good	Works great and easy to install. Be mindful that your TV needs CEC supported in order to ask google to turn your TV on and off. Mine doesn't and that really upsets me. The product itself works pretty well.

840	Nicole	5	Makes life easier	We purchased this for my father's room. He has suffered from strokes and has limited use of his hands so changing channels/ controlling the volume are out of his limitations.

876	WorkOutFanatic	4	Decent Buy	Chromecast is easy to use. Only default is that if you are playing a movie, in the middle it’s difficult to pause or turn off. Takes a few mins for your phone/iPad/android to talk to chromecast.

893	Nice	5	Better than the old one	I have no single problem with this chromecast. Easy to set up
894	Sydisback55	4	easy to set up	east to set up, works great,. didn't know this existed! awesome.
895	Beemom	5	Love this product	I purchased this Chromecast as part of my YouTubeTV subscription. It was a very easy setup and works great. It is very user friendly
896	Heather	4	Great	Great product but it tends to freeze up and restarts.
897	Potterhead	5	Great product!	Great product! Really makes it easy to cast my phone on the tv!
898	sharat	5	Best casting device	Works awesome to cast anything from my chrome browser, Android phone. YouTube videos
899	ntech	5	works as intended	Google chromecast works as intended. I don't know enough to say whether it's better or worse than Roku and other similar items.
900	ZZBolt	4	Works as advertised	had some trouble getting it set up initially but since has worked very well
901	Johns	5	Great options	This is a winner if you are looking to expand your entertainment options!
902	Mikey	1	It sucks	This product sucks!!! I will never buy this product again.
903	Pauline	5	Great Product	Love casting from my phone to the tv. It is so convenient.
904	Elly	5	I can watch youtube everywhere now	It was a very easy installation and streaming from my PC and android phone is a breeze. I am very happy.
905	Mamie	5	Love it	Enjoy being able to watch anything in my TV. What a great product.
906	Maury	5	It works	The price is right. It works great to cast what's on my laptop screen to the TV in a group discussion instead of having many people hovering over the screen.
907	TraceYaromi	5	So simple	"Plug and play, anything from your phone via the google home app, or some apps can cast direct.
I do wish it could function on it's own without a phone at times though"
908	Srivatsa	5	No issues and works well	Google chrome cast works as expected as other google products. No issues as of now
909	homegadgets2	5	Great product	Great product for the money easy to use for beginner.
910	ConMan	5	Worked perfectly	Great device, great price, worked flawlessly out of the box!
911	LeoDaLion	4	It's a nice addition to Google Home & Arlo	Together my Google Home mini, Arlo Pro cameras and the Chromecast can stream the Arlo cameras on my TV by just asking Google Home to stream which ever camera I choose. Honestly had I not purchased Google Home and have Arlo security cameras set up around the house I would not have purchased Chromecast. I feel it doesn't do more than a Amazon Fire stick and the fact that it doesn't come with a remote so using a phone or tablet is pretty much your only option is something I don't like. I would only recommend it to those who have the same set up I have at home. If being able to stream Arlo on your big TV is something you would like to do, this is pretty sweet.
912	Kevin	5	Easy set up, works exactly as stated.	I bought this item to cast my laptop to my TV. I needed to cast a presentation for class to be recorded. Worked great!
913	Johnny	5	Great for casting	Great for casting from my iPhone to my tv. Plus has all college basketball games
914	mattstang	4	Great device to cast movies to my TV	I bought this to cast movies to my TV from the Google Play Movies app. Works great. I can use my phone as a remote to start, stop, rewind, skip forward, skip back the movie that's playing. A bonus feature is that I can still use my phone to do other things while the movie is being casted to my TV, like surfing the internet to look something up.
915	southbendcarp	5	Swell product	"Fairly easy to use and makes my ""dumb"" tv smart! Casting is fairly easy and stress-free."
916	JoeP	5	ChromeCast	Great Product. Use it all the time to stream Netflix. Buying it was easy and simple. Best Buy is a Great store. With knowledgeable staff.
917	SaiG	5	Great chromecast	Awesome product and streaming is good. The following option is really hepful...included power adapter isn't really necessary as long as you have a powered USB Port on your TV to plug it in to.
918	Patrick	4	Great product but sometimes need to reset	This is a great product but sometimes need to reset because my mobile phone cannot connect
919	Ja54	5	Great!	Love these have 3 now. Would highly recommend. Easy to install.

923	Scott	5	Cool!	Works well. Easy to set up.I use it daily. And updates make it better and better.
924	wass	5	Good product	Easy to use and set up. and very reliable with connections
925	Buster	5	Nice.works great	Got this so I could get Netflix on my TV. Works great .
926	Paulie	4	Loved it	Awesome so good all amazing thebestest the finest. Yeah buddy
927	Txaopi	5	Game changer!	This is a must have item if you use Netflix or Hulu! Super easy to use and apparently even better with an android device (although also works with iPhone)
928	Denny	5	Like Item, But Doesn't Work on All Devices	Love Chromecast, but can't download app on all of my devices (i.e. newest Kindle Fire) or at least get Netflix to run on it. There are work arounds to download the app, but still can't cast Netflix on the Kindle Fire as it is a competitor with Amazon Prime. It should fully work on any android device, and does on my other android devices, though.
929	Msanchez	4	Good quality and price	Satisfied with my purchase. Good price and quality.
930	MrsW2013	5	User friendly	I bought a chromecast a few months ago for the living room tv. I loved it so much, we decided to buy another one for the bedroom t.v.
931	carynlea	5	Cut the Cable Cord with this item	"Chromecast allows you to 'cast' shows, videos, etc from your phone or tablet to your TV. 
It's super easy to set up and we gave up DirectTV after installing this item."
932	renee	5	Good for those without Cable TV	I love using this. I previously was watching everything like Netflix and Hulu on the Playstation and they were taking up a lot of room. It pairs great with the Google Home! I highly recommend to anyone who is just paying for those streaming services.
933	Joey	4	Easy set up	It's a great option for streaming through your cell at the TV!
934	Rush	5	Great buy	Works perfectly. I love streaming Netflix with it.
935	LilysMom	5	awesome	Took a bit to register but it works as advertised. I would purchase again
936	Beef	5	My go to device	This is my go to device for casting movies from my phone to the TV. It's small and it hides behind my TV and the quality is good.
937	Jack	5	Great streamer	No problems on my Android for internet streaming for 4 mo. now and love it. Can't do that with competitor devices. I ended up getting a 2nd one. Used it in different parts of the house, no problem. Just cast the movie, then you can turn the phone off and start watching with popcorn. Although this device is plugged in to the HDMI it is dangling on the back of the TV. with the power cord plugged into it too.
938	Fittidawg77	5	Works great!	Easy to set up and use. My 10yr uses it to cast her you tube videos on the TV.
939	Wanderotter	5	Chromcast	Solved my no internet/ cable issue at our cabin. Use with hotspot to stream content onto TV
940	miguelvilchis	5	Great media streaming device for a low price	The chromecast functions as advertised and is so small that in any setup it could be hidden and also the fact that is really simple to set up is a good media streaming device for anyone on a budget.
941	ENRP	5	Love it!	Amazing product. I love that I can control what I'm watching from my smart phone.
942	mahoot	4	Chromecast is a good cast	This works great. I love that I can sleep in a little bit longer on the weekends because I can cast a movie for my kids to the TV in the living room when they get up ridiculously early all from the comfort of my own bed.
943	Trevor	4	Exactly what you need.	Great to make non-smart TV's smart. Only downfall is you either need your phone to control it or a Google Home. I kinda wish it had a remote like the Amazon Fire Stick.
944	JeffE	4	as expected	It's chromecast. Great product. Even better if you have google home.
945	shoefly58	5	Excellent....	"Works great. Use it in my garage shop connected to a 21"" monitor to stream YouTube and Netflix."
946	CRan	5	Works perfectly	Any older TV that doesn't have this needs it! It really does help facilitate things for casting smoothly and seamlessly. I really enjoy it its a quick and easy product to use.
947	SayitsPaint	5	Love it	I love my Chromecast- I use it almost daily. Easy to set up, easy to connect to, easy to use.
948	Mina	4	Great Chromecast	Great Chromecast. Esay to use and the best part is that it is controlled by any android phone or tablet.
949	HiREV	5	Easy and convenient	Quick and easy setup! Best for those without a smart tv.
950	Bmj921	5	Awesome	Got it for my mom. Has an easy setup, lots of apps to use with it.. very simple to use
951	Mony	4	Works fine	I’ve used the original google chrome cast before and I loved it. Decided to buy another chrome cast for my TV. However, this does everything I need but sometime there’s a delay connection unlike the original one.
952	NotNow	4	Great beginning drawing tablet	This is a great beginners drawing tablet. The S pen is amazing and functions well with the ineractive screen. The only issues I've had with it over a few months is that the tablet will crash if I try to do too much with it with drawing programs. This tablet is great but definitely has its limitations.
953	MWatkins85	5	Great Streaming Device	This product is great for streaming media from your cell phone or tablet to your tv. Not only from streaming aps, but your personal photos and videos are able to be displayed on your tv!
954	Tharlow92	4	Great deal!	The Google Chromecast is very easy to set up and use.
955	Aberg	5	Great for streaming	Streams everything I need and more. More content than any one person could ever watch in a lifetime.
956	awills	5	Great way to watch your shows or movies on your TV	I am so glad I purchased this. It’s easy to use. My 9 year old loves using the iPad apps and casting Netflix or Hulu on to the tv using the google chrome cast. And it’s great for traveling.
957	NYC914	5	Google is the best	can cast all your movie apps with good wire.......
958	Michelle	5	GREAT!	I am loving my chromecast! It plays all of my streaming needs from hulu to netflix to even pandora! Right from my phone or ipad! I would highly recommend.
959	Bobby	5	Great price for a very usable gadget for tv shows	Thanks to Google for making an inexpensive way to cut the cable.....I am now saving nearly 60 per month, saved the price of the item in one month....that is a good buy.
960	Shane	3	Ehhh	I am not to happy with this. The only app that I can seem to use is Netflix.
961	Mark	5	Easy and affordable	For 35 bucks and the ease of use, I bought a few for gifts and all the televisions in the house.
962	Rahman	5	I like it	I was not sure before buying it. My family is enjoying the ease of chrome cast now.
963	Tiger15	2	Could be better	Bought this Comcast thinking I could use it with Direct tv app. Did not work . Very disappointed.
964	Skylight74	5	Great product.	I had the previous version of this chromecast had it for about 3 years. Until my kids broke it. Well worth my money.
965	MrsBMartin	5	Great device	I bought this device over a year ago and it never gets old!
966	SamD	5	Just Awesome!!	Awesome product, good product, overall nice product.
967	Anita	5	Just the best ever	I love love love this product make everything more easy in my tv time.
968	Norm	4	Great product!	Basically turns your non smart tv into a smart tv!
969	hamlet	5	Works well	I am a senior and this was pretty easy to install and download. It takes one hookup to the back of your tv. The instructions are simple and I`m enjoying streaming from my computer.
970	Cser306	5	Perfect buy	Easy to use, great quality, fair price. Nothing about this item is difficult or dislijable
971	Jeff	4	Just what we needed	Needed it to stream. Like being able to control it from my phone. Perfect for what I needed
972	Ktyler	4	So easy	This is easy to install and use. Works great to hook our tablet to an older model TV do the kids can watch downloaded movies together.
973	Trisharose	2	Followed instructions and still not working right	It was supposed to be easy to use but it wasn’t and so far, too difficult to get it to run smoothly.
974	Patsy	5	Like it	Use it all the time - mainly for the you tube videos
975	Drew	5	Easy to sync and use	Chromecast to cast things from my laptop onto my tv and it works great! The quality is perfect and its easy to use.
976	Lenny70	4	Works ok	Got this product with some gift cards that were about to expire. Streams nicely, nothing spectacular about it
977	Best	4	Nice	"Good to put your pictures on your tv.

984	pogey	5	great streaming device	works perfectly with you tube tv. streams without a glitch
985	1234321	4	Functional Chromecast	Chromecast is great. Works with netflix and has no issues. Occasionally it doesn't connect the way it should but this can be fixed with unplugging it. Solid product on the market
986	Hanney	5	So cool!	It’s awesome! Definitely eliminated a smart tv! I didn’t want to spend so much on a smart TV to watch Netflix but now that this is purchased I can stream from my phone, and tablet!
987	Brunorm	5	Very good!	I Love it......great product I will buy again great!
988	DonZ	5	Great for streaming or mirroring	Works great for streaming to your tv. Easy to install and connect to WiFi. I would recommend the Google home app if you are using more than one Chromecast at a time.
989	ob1t	5	great product	Comcast was a great product to buy. The representative was very informative and helped pick the comcast
990	Shelby	5	Simple, Effective	We bought the Chromecast on a whim. (Been having trouble streaming Netflix due to WiFi lag.) Plugged in the Chromecast and started streaming, was very simple to use and the picture is perfect, doesn't lag at all. Been using it for 4 months now, never once had a problem!
991	Jeevan	5	Most affordable price	Bestbuy is the one best store to give quality products and best price
992	Drake	5	Makes casting simple	Purchased to view pictures and watch videos from phone and works perfect.
993	Menyawga	5	Does what it says	Wr have an apple to downstairs, but we got this for my mother in law since she uses an android phone. The chrome cast has been much better for her to use her content on the same TV. The lower price made it an easy second streamer.
994	Bfm14	5	Great product	"Fast and easy installation
High quality 
Great product for a great price."
995	Jmazock	5	Works incredibly well.	Hooked up to my Panasonic tv. Works well in conjunction with my google home.
996	Member	5	Great	Works great for all my streaming programs. Recommended
997	Mariah	5	Great device for a small tv	Great device for watching movies and tv shows without paying a high cable bill.
998	BigJohnStud16	5	Great upgrade	Had the gen 1 Chromecast and it worked well but was definitely slow at times. This new gen is much snappier and works more efficiently. It also responds to controls from your phone (such as pausing a video) without delay, which occurred some on the gen 1. As long as you know and understand the limitations that can come from a Chromecast versus other streaming products, I think you’ll be satisfied with this.
999	Rama	5	Nice one	Best price.excellent quality.good condition.thanyou
1000	Elephant	5	Great product	Works great all the time, provides myself and family console great entertainment! I love to take this to the hotel so the kids can watch videos from my phone to the tv.
1001	Siyi	4	Good	We bought this last Christmas. As we have Apple TVs at home I don’t see much plus from this product. In terms of quality it’s great
1002	MrPugs	5	Got it for when I was a road warrior	Worked great at the hotel allowed me to watch what I wanted
1003	Mimimaria	5	Enjoying my Google Chromecast	I am enjoying my Google Chromecast... My son said this would be easier for me, especially since I can operate straight from my phone....
1004	Jazzi	5	works great	works great needs better instructions but if you can work a camera you can figure it out
1005	Otter	5	Great way to enjoy my shows	I am pleased with my decision to purchase this product. I can watch my shows in silence in my bedroom which I couldn't do before because I don't have cable access.
1006	Bati	5	Just Great	This is a great way to turn every TV into a Smart TV!
1007	Best	5	Awesome	Great investment. Don't even need cable anymore it has everything
1008	Eddy	5	Great programming	Definitely recommend to everyone that loves music and tv
1009	LadyM	4	Great Google product	Works 99% of the time and responds well to the Google Home Assistant.

1011	MaryInIL	5	Wow, great item!	What convenience, great item for any room in the house.
1012	Googlewifiyes	5	Cheap and simple	Allows me to turn my dumb tv into smart. Easy to setup and use. Misch faster than the gen1 Chromecast
1013	Steph	5	Excellent	I love this chrome cast! I can cozy up on the couch and watch my favorite shows!
1014	Ngheno625	5	Great portable device	I like the product. It is portable and work on any wifi. I use it with my Youtube TV subscription service. I think the quality is great and I haven't had any issues with my device.
1015	Madonna	5	Works great!	Love the Chromecast!! I was able to cut off my cable & I now can stream on any TV. Saved me a lot of money!! Connects to any TV as long as you have internet!
1016	Nike	4	Great device	Works as expected. Great to pair with tvs that dont have apps
1017	ainseattle	4	Pretty good device, apps limited	We use our Chromecast on a secondary monitor in the house usually when our kids are ill, so they can watch Netflix or other shows. You can't use Amazon Prime video unless you 'cast' from a computer (we have a laptop that we can put in the room). Our household is primarily an Apple iPhone household, so the compatibility is ok, though likely not as good as it would be with Android phones. You can cast from various apps (useful to cast ESPN, etc when the other TV is in use by the kids). For the price, it's a good deal.
1018	Chance	5	Chromecast	Perfect for watching tv without cable! I love being able to use my phone or computer to cast what I want to watch.
1019	Djex	5	Watching Youtube on TV	Great little unit and super easy to connect it. No need to program it.
1020	RP124	5	Great device	Great for my need working perfect. Great for price
1021	xMyNightmareX	5	The Best	Best little streaming device out there. Doesn’t lag up when using it with the phone and it’s fast. Most smart tv apps are laggy and slow. This thing works great.
1022	SEANIZZLE	4	Excellent product.	Work well with my lop top and my Samsung galaxy s8+,only downfall is that it freezes sometimes.
1023	Mimiof2	5	Love our new chromecast!	After recently buying a new Sony TV that had built in chrome cast we wanted that same functionality on our bedroom TV, an older Sony with no smart TV features. Installing the new Chromecast on an HDMI port was relatively easy, although using the website link provided in the instructions did not work. We were eventually able to configure the new device using recently downloaded Google Home on our phone and then stream from Allcast to the bedroom TV. We haven't downloaded any apps yet to the Chromecast device yet, and not even sure we will, since using Youtube, Netflix, etc. on our phones and then casting to the device works just fine.
1024	Jay0682	5	Love my chromecast!	I own 3 now in my house, and have no issues with them. Installs easy, easy to setup and works perfectly with my iPhone, iPad, and Google home.
1025	51846	5	Excellent device	Product is very helpful in this era of technology. Being able to connect various devices is a plus.
1026	metoo	5	exactly what i wanted	its exactly what needed when out of town. simple to use.
1027	Motras	4	Awesome streaming device	It was my first time buying one of this device cuz um I own already a firetv stick and I gotta say, this is a awesome product. Since the firetv stick doesnt stream pretty well live tv or something I was to stream directly from my laptop, chromecast does an outstanding job. I'm not disappointed
1028	FamilyFun	5	Keep on casting	Love it. We can watch stuff together on tv instead of on our phones or tablets separately. Cheaper than buying a new smart tv.
1029	bob77	4	Good little device	The new Chromecast is simply amazing. It improves on everything it needed to and is now and more reliable in rooms furthest from my router.
1030	Sharon	5	Great for parents	My parents are not very tech savvy and absolutely love the ease of use with the Chromecast. They are now able to use apps and cast their favorite shows from overseas right onto their living room tv.
1031	Refill	2	Not what expected	After purchasing the Chromecast, I quickly realized that it didn't work the way it was suggested to work with the Google Home. For many of the Chromecast functions to work, your TV needs to connect to other programs, many of which cost money.
1032	Aaron29	5	Best Streaming box on the Market	Great for Streaming everything. Make sure you have a high end 4k HDR TV for this, also an Ethernet port near by your TV in order to stream in 4k.
1033	Salama	4	Good for a beginner	The set up is easy. Streaming is excellent. However, you need a device, smartphone or tablet, to control. I prefer using a remote to review the channels. But for the price, it is worth.
1034	Golden	5	Chromecast- 2nd Generation	"Answered my concern about be able to stream YouTubeTV . Couldn't do it with my first Chromecast which is 1st generation.
Other than that, works as the original ChromeCast"
1035	kayloren	5	Nice streaming	Works as expected right out of the box. Very simple to use!
1036	olainez	5	Turn your wireless device into your remote control	Cast from your phone, tablet or laptop. Plug Chromecast into your HDTV via the HDMI interface, connect to your Wi-Fi network and cast from your Apple® iPhone® or iPad®, Android phone or tablet, Mac or Windows laptop or Chromebook.
1037	bodie	5	love it	A lot of fun watvhing you tune on tv, so much interesting stuff om you tube
1038	Axlsmimi	5	Easy install	Super easy to install and now I can stream video from my phone.
1039	KimL	4	Great Product	Chrome Cast performed as per stated specifications
1040	Matt541	5	Great universal product	Excellent device to cast onto any tv or HDMI input. Controls tv power functions(if compatible). Overall great google device.
1041	gillitar	5	We use it for everything	I absolutely love google, and we had another Chromecast just like this one already, however we had to have another! We got sick of moving the Chromecast from the TV in our bedroom to the TV in our kitchen. We had a lot of issues with the first Chromecast but since this upgraded one was released we've had no problems with it. Highly recommend. Unless you want to watch something on Amazon you can basically watch anything with it!
1042	Nirmal	5	Makes my dumb tv smart	Fast and reliable, easy to connect to. Made my old led tv smart
1043	hola	5	super Chromecast	It works perfect and it is very easy to install and use

1046	Redfish	5	Great product for on the move people	I love the ease of use and portability of this product.
1047	Rooney	5	Great	Works exactly how we need it to. Only complaint is it has to be plugged in and the cord is a little short but easy fix
1048	sdhdmi	5	Great Chromecast	Easy Install to tivi and connect to wifi less than 5 Minute..
1049	Kuqattan	5	Excellent product very successful implement to use	Very slick and perfect size as an addition to the smart TV, only comparable to AppleTV. Now I have the best of both worlds. I use it for my Iphone/Ipad, PC internet viewing by simply clicking on the Chromecast icon inside the screen I am watching, No complicated steps to take. High definition WYSIWYG. Simply impressive.
1050	Teephani	5	Great Product	The chrome cast was very easy to install. It is also very cheap. I didn't have a smart tv but wanted to use my tv as a same tv.
1051	buzz	3	Works OK	Works OK, but slow. Communication with PC and router, only about 13 feet away, poor and unreliable. Haven't used it again since the first time I set it up two months ago.
1052	1548fx	5	Great item	Works as described. Great performance. Will buy another one.
1053	Chub	5	Excellent streaming device	Device is used frequently, is easy to operate and provides excellent program viewing.
1054	Patty	4	Great product	I am loving this! I can watch anything from my phone on the tv while I am doing other things.

1056	DrummerBoy	5	Excellent Purchase!	Friends and family have this so I bought it....best decision ever! So many movies, so many choices!
1057	Doug2166	4	Mostly for video streaming	I mainly bought this after I discovered I could not stream video through Amazon Fire Stick with new phone. It is very easy to use, although initially I had problems connecting to WiFi
1058	CorinneLS	5	Make your TV Smart!	We purchased two of these for our TV's that were not smart capable....perfect for making them web connected at a small price!
1059	Gizmo1203	5	Updated Chromecast	The updated google chromecast is so much faster than the previous version. I really enjoyed how quickly I am able to cast to my big TV. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to upgrade their old chromecast.
1060	Roley	5	Love Chromecast	I think Chromecast is a great tool. We have a new smart tv, and I think Chromecast is easier to navigate. We have two of them.
1061	GabM	5	Best thing ever	I actually bought this as s gift because I already have two of my own but it’s the best! I use this every single day! I don’t have cable I stream everything I watch and this makes it a breeze! HIGHLY recommend to anyone!
1062	tmeyer3491	4	Great for its specific purpose	This is an easy way to cast from pc or google device to any TV with available HDMI and power nearby. Unfortunately, not compatible with iPhone or other Apple products. Would have gotten 5 stars if the proprietary walls were removed.
1063	Modemer	5	Does what I need it to. Casting from my phone to T	Does what I need it to. Casting from my phone to TV
1064	Tony	5	Easy setup and so easy to use !!	Best casting device for computer and phone. Steady signal and great resolution on HDMI port
1065	Tino	5	Easy to use streaming tool	Setting up the Chromecast was a breeze. This device is simple to use to stream directly to your tv.
1066	Jusjudi	5	Good product for TV's	I bought this for my grandsons TV so he had access to NetFlix. The TV he has is not a smart TV so this gives him more programming choices.
1067	Kiza	5	Turn your tv into a smart tv	I have a non smart tv in my bedroom and wanted to watch Netflix. I was able to watch it with the chrome cast and was able to mirror a lot of things from my phone on the tv.
1068	Sammyr98	5	Great for Netflix, the Internet, and other apps	I already had an older chrome cast for myself, but bought this as a gift for my parents. They love it, as I knew they would, and would recommend this to anyone.

1070	Chuckfin222	5	Casting made easy	Very affordable exactly what was need to stream from phone or tablet, p.c to any non-smart tv definitely recommended
1071	gny13	5	Great item to have	Functions very well and does what it's suppose to. I use the chromecast to mirror my laptop browser tabs and even when i want to watch a movie from laptop or phone.
1072	Sherif	4	The best at what it does	As far as streaming products go this one is the simplest and easiest way watch content on your TV. The one and only issue I have with it is the fact that it dose not work with Amazon service.
1073	JosephD	4	Chromecast Rules	Love this, so simple. I can use everything from my phone, tablet, and laptop to cast to my tv without any problem.
1074	Mista513	5	The best gets better.	"I still use the 2 original Chromecast I bought on release and figured the newer one can't be any better. We'll I was wrong, smaller, the magnetic ""clip"" gives it a cleaner look and it seems to load faster and not drop connection sometimes like the old version."
1075	Hemant	5	Turns my non smart TV into smart TVQ	"I am using this with my Sannyo LED TV which does not have WiFi 
I can stream my phone which helps me discuss while shopping household items. 

I do miss that I am not able to stream amazon prime on it."

1083	OnlineShopperOnly	5	Perfect device for streaming!	This device has allowed me to cut the cable with the major cable companies. Who needs them when you can stream anything from your phone!

1085	Black	5	Chromecast	A must have for streaming music and videos. Would recommend.
1086	Kimberly	5	Great for screen mirror	I really think this was a great purchase thay I made. I have been able to watch my shows from my phone to tv which is what I asked for
1087	Frank	5	Works well. Cast most devices to TV.	Good value device. Easily cast most devices (computer, phone etc.) to your TV screen. If there is a negative, it's that I haven't figured out how to use it in a hotel...or if that is even possible. The Chromecast and device must be on the same WiFi network and I can't find a work around as hotel networks usually require room # and names, etc. to join the network while the Chromecast is just looking for a WiFi password as you would have at home. Works great at home!
1088	nikkinicole	5	Great tech for low price	Bought this to use to watch tv shows, movies, etc. Great price and haven't had any issues! Highly recommend.
1089	Chuckstar	5	Good	I like this chrome cast. Especially if you are an android user, it is very easy to figure out and set up. I will say if you get multiple chromecasts you have to have really good wifi. My wifi has crashed a lot. I wish you could cast the same thing to several chromecasts at the same thing.
1090	Locarion	5	Easy to use and quicker than the original	Upgraded from the old, more stick-shaped Chromecast to this version. Everything displays much quicker and it is still just as easy to use as previously. Fantastic companion for any of the Google Home products as well!

1093	OldMom	4	Cool gadget	"Easy to set up, great item, but often drops the connection to my Wi-Fi, then it's difficult to reestablish. 
Awesome, when it's working"
1094	Fertwangler	5	Chromecast	Bought the Chromecast primarily as a way to cast videos from my Plex server. My Plex server is wonky, but the Chromecast works as expected.

1101	Calimatt3	4	Great for on the go	I wasn’t a fan of this because Of the way it requires a WiFi set up. But it works great for casting.
1102	Mister	5	Not the best but good enough	Not the best, but good enough to pair with my google home mini
1103	mortemus	5	great for watching sports	All I need to watch my sports! Works great and no large cable bill.
1104	Ajrivera	5	Stream away my friends	I'm usually watching movies or shows on the go so to have some way to stream it from my phone to the TV is amazing. Well don't Google.
1105	Bobby	5	Great gets it done	Does the job can't complain wish it worked with impad
1106	rahulawale	4	more expectation	Great product but I wish it could do more. Its good for certain apps, But I wish it had more support with apple products. Like it would be nice if you could mirror or iPhone or Mac screen.
1107	George	5	Cast almost anything to any TV	So many apps support Chromecast and you can cast any Android phone and Chrome. Can put almost anything on TV
1108	Buddy	5	Easy to Use, Always Reliable	"Use it everyday to easily watch my YouTube subsciption videos. Paired with the Google Home, you can just use your voice to go to the next video or turn up the volume. It is al set up in the Google Home app, they make it pretty easy to set up. And Love the backdrops that play when the Chromecast is not playing anything.
My Parents, Sister, and Grandparents all use a Chromecast. Just makes it easy to consume media on a bigger screen."
1109	ClydeM	5	Google home	Love the control with Google assistant and being able to turn on and off

1118	AiPhi	5	Great product	Love it! Turn my non-smart tv to smart tv. Easy set up
1119	kayrogal	4	Ease of use with multiple apps	Chose chrome cast and highly satisfied. Was recommended by a friend and I back that up.
1120	Sarah32	4	Easy to use	Works well, and fairly simple to set up. My only complaint is that it doesn’t work always with my college’s WiFi but I think it’s just the WiFi is really bad.
1121	eastbayareanerd	5	"Still better than ""smart"" TV cast"	I bought this extra Chromecast as even the newer smart TV cast capabilities are not as good as the Chromecast.
1122	JRockstar50	5	Gotta Have one	Versatile and portable. Use it with a Google home as well

1130	ErikaV	3	Good for casting	I have a Motorola G5 so this is the only way I can cast my cellphone content to my tv. It's okay, but it sometimes goes crazy slow. It works so I'm happy. Blessings
1131	daughtkom	5	Makes my not smart TV smart	Got this for an older TV in our bedroom. Works great to add some smarts to an otherwise simple TV.
1132	sandrade	5	Good product	Was very easy to set up and works great for Netflix
1133	Brendle	4	Good, but be mindful of your home network...	I needed something fast and simple so I could watch Netflix and YouTube in bed, which this does wonderfully. What it doesn't do so wonderfully is broadcast your laptop's screen to your TV if your network connection is terrible (farthest room in the worst corner of the apartment!) So be mindful of that!
1134	Migue	5	Great items	Excelent, its very good i want get other for my parents
1135	slna0201	5	Awesome New Version of Chromecast	I had the original version of the chrome cast and I wanted the new version because it could connect to my 5ghz wireless network. I can stream in 4K now and it looks great.
1136	HPATEL	5	Good product for me	Good google product with good price and good improvement in new version.
1137	lulu24	4	To use with my google home mini	The products works great, I got it so I could use it in conjunction with my google home mini. It doesn't really do anything that my smart TVs don't already do.

1147	Dave	5	Chromecast	Product works just fine and was easy to install and set up. I also have an older model and am very satisfied with both.
1148	golodroda	5	great tech device	It let me change my led plasma tv into a smart TV .
1149	Grayfamily	4	Great for children who love youtube	We purchased this along with the google home so that my 7 and 3 year old wouldn’t have to try and keep track of a remote. Instead whenever they’re looking to watch something the just tell the home mini to play “chases corner from youtube in the living room”. However, sometime I do wish It came with a remote cause when the internet is down and the phones are dead the chrome cast become useless.
1150	theGO	4	Great for the ease of casting video/music apps	Google Chromecast is great for the ease casting video and music apps. The Chromecast obviously works well with the Google apps, but still works will with a vast selection of third party video apps. Using your phone, tablet, or laptop as the controller is great, but I feel a remote with a direct connection with the Chromecast with resetting the device if the device you're using as a remote has a error. Overall, it is a great casting device with a variety of features. It is always great watching YouTube on the TV instead of my phone.
1151	Sonic62	4	Enjoy the link to Google Home	Get way to link applications to a non-smart TV. We enjoy the ability to use this with our phones and Google Home controls.
1152	Gchap	5	Easy to install	Chrome is easy to install and use ; we have dropped cable and mainly stream now
1153	1940Pickup	5	Easy Peasy	I am not a computer wizard. This Chromecast was simple to hook up and get working. Just what I was looking for.
1154	MacUser	5	Works as advertised.	"It is so easy to stream audio and/or video from a PC or a Mac or a Phone pr a Google Home to the ChromeCast!
If you get this, you will be using it a lot!"
1155	Mike	5	Chrome	Purchased for casting presentation from phone to monitor. Easy to setup and use
1156	kndrggr	5	Great Item	I got this for my nephew for his TV. Worked as promise.
1157	franklin1	5	way better than cable	this is an excellent addition to an antenna for people who don't like cable
1158	Jsap	4	google cast	this good if you want cast your photos or use any google products but then i want to stream thing from off my phone doest work as well as it should .
1159	monalisa1234	5	Great for entertainment	Many decisions to be made!!! Price is excellent!!!

1161	Rhpsv	5	Great for first time user	Easy to use and look up items to see on your tv. really enjoyed it.
1162	pogey	5	great product	This is my second chromecast and I am just as pleased with this one as I was the first. I purchased it to cast youtube TV as we recently cut the cord from satellite tv. It works perfectly, no hiccups whatsoever.
1163	Vanessa	5	Great purchase	I'm loving my new chrome cast. The setup was easy and streaming my favorite shows from my iPad is a breeze. The price is a great price point as well.
1164	RWTechman	4	IMPROVED CHROMECAST	I LIKE TH NEW DESIGN, AND THE CABLE ACTUALLY WORKS BETTER THAN THE OLD STICK. YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GET IT INTO ANY TV OR MONITOR. A BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN FIRESTICK. BUT A GOOD DEVICE
1165	andiamo71	5	Great for streaming from phone	I bought this to turn my 'dumb' Samsung plasma into a smart tv. Being a sports fan, i'm unwilling to give up the superiority of plasma for inferior LED and it's motion problems just for the sake of having a Smart tv. I considered the others, Roku, Amazon stick, etc, but went with the Chromecast in the end. Setup is easy; just plug it into an HDMI port (mine runs through my receiver, but you can plug it directly into the tv), download the Google Home app to your phone, point it at the home wifi, and you're done. In the end this is the easiest to use; no channel searching, fumbling with an extra remote, what-have-you. Just play a compatible app and stream it to the TV. I'll open youtube, do a quick search, and stream a kids video for the baby much quicker than with the other Smart tv in the house. Apps like Popcorntime, Bobby Movie, and VLC are also compatible, which is great. In essence, your phone replaces the remote, which is much more convenient for finding or pulling up and playing content quickly. Streams are perfect and in amazing HD quality. No complaints. Definitely worth the $. In fact, I bought a second one for travel.
1166	mischell	5	Great	Very happy with it. I am very glad to purchase it.
1167	Frank	5	Works great	I used this to connect my car’s entertainment system to my phone for casting movies it works great.
1168	Kams	5	Wonderful streaming device	This is an amazing device, its has mobile mirroring option which my kid loves to cast while using the phone and easy to connect. Also, easy to cast YouTube as well.
1169	Rzuzu	4	Good but has issues	So it's a great device but something has issues streaming because of my internet. Laptop signal is great but this pick up radius is obviously smaller!
1170	Soldier007	5	Great product	i bought this google cast unit for my 55 inch non smart tv and works wonderfully. my tv is now smarter than ever and application with-in are Great!! I would recommend this product .
1171	Quansautorepair	5	Great casting device	No lag!!! Streams fast and very clear!!! And much better looking design!!!

1173	norm53142	3	Casting	Not crazy about casting. I still prefer using the remote.
1174	Sledgrl	4	Quick and simple	Great price and easy to install, ready to use in minutes!
1175	Bert	5	Good bye cable	All three of my TV's have it and I used the iPads to remote into it
1176	meno	5	great equipment	Excellent experience could recommend it widely due to its high accounting and experience
1177	si78	5	Love it	Works great... streams extremely well. Love the pictures it throws up when not in use...
1178	RushDave	5	Easy to use streaming device	I use the device for replicating computer screens and it is a perfect solution for that purpose. The basic streaming apps also work well - seems more reliable than an Amazon Fire that I have.
1179	upadlib	5	easy, simple set up for me and I am not that good	It is easy to ramp up the application. Switching back and forth to cast on and cast of is effecient and simple to do. I dont have a smart TV so the google device was and is ideal for our home entertainment situation. It is inexpensive and as I said, easy to install
1180	Peter	4	Great TV companions only if ....	Okay, If you are into Google Ecosystem or if you have google home speaker at home. this is the best TV companion for you to buy. but if you want to buy just this for Netflix or play something else on TV. it would skip it and FireStick instead.
1181	Maxiracauchi	5	Great product	The seller explained me everything, i was so well informed
1182	Sahil	5	Great Product	I really like Chromecast. A good alternative to have Roku / Amazon fire.
1183	crusader123	4	Great For Streaming Content	Chromecast is a great device to stream content from your mobile device.
1184	Dave	5	Works great with my Chromebook	I bought this so I could display my Chromebook screen and the TV, it works great. Very easy to do and now my photos can be as big as I need and the Chromebook takes care of it all.
1185	Cactiskid	5	Great Device	Now A Days with so much material coming from online sources You have to have one of these for your TV. Mine was rasonably priced and does an excellent job.
1186	Lynn	5	Great product	Very easy to stream on TV, it is just that the initial installation and connect to IPad was kind of confusing.
1187	Tito	5	Great tool	I was able to convert my regular TV. I can now see Netflix, HBO Now and YouTube with my Google Home.
1188	tr4gik	5	Best streamer hands on.	"Got it for a small kitchen Tv to make it ""smart"" absolutely loved it. fast easy, and works with my google home."
1189	Tonni	5	Awesome	I love this little gadget.. so easy to use and take it everywhere works with everything so far
1190	rvnap2272	4	It works good for basic streaming	If you want simple features as streaming Netflix, Hulu or Vevo, This small device is perfect for you. It does fast streaming.
1191	Loveohio	5	Easy set up	Purchased this since we received a Google Home for Christmas. Now we can turn our tv on via Google Home. Works well.
1192	Shilpi	5	Excellent	I bought this product for me to use it. I am using it and really good and meeting my requirement.
1193	Studentmom80	5	Compact streaming!	I love being able to cast from my phone to my tv in my room without having to move my PS4 around. Easy to use and I love the screensavers.
1194	Balward	5	Works seamlessly with other Google products	"I have a Samsung ""smart"" TV in my bedroom that is a few years old and has the older Smart TV Hub which is awful and slow so I knew a third party option was needed. Originally I had an amazon fire TV hooked up to the TV, but at the beginning of the year they dropped support for YouTube, so to the store I went. The set up of this is so incredibly simple, as it is with any Google product. This allows me to use my Google Home, or my Pixel 2 XL to turn on/off my tv with my voice. Everything casts perfectly and quickly. The only gripe I have is whenever I cast a YouTube video or Netflix when the TV is off, when it turns on the Chromecast defaults to max volume. Now that I know to prepare for that, I can turn it down before the audio actually starts. Not a huge issue but worth mentioning."
1195	sleepy	4	Works well	Stable connection, loads quickly and streams without buffering or stuttering
1196	Techie	3	Compatibility Issues	Worked ok for some apps. But problems when using with apple videos I had. Returning for Apple tv
1197	JONATHAN	5	GREAT FOR STREAMING	I LOVE THIS CHROMECAST ITS SO CONVENIENT TO STREAM WITH
1198	aj1990	5	Awesome	The Chrome cast is very good and excellent for my TV.

1202	DJTricks	5	Simple and no issues	Simple and works as expected. The price was on sale so that was a bonus.
1203	Tiece	5	Worked Perfectly!	Gave me the ability to watch my hometown team when they weren't on the national network shows. Couldn't have lived without it!
1204	Sharon	5	Dad loved it	Bought for my dad and he loves it. Easy to use and compatible with phone. His tv is now smart with all the apps and Netflix. Easy plugs right into back of tv.
1205	RobinFL	5	It works	Little dongle works to let the Google Home talk to the TV, if the TV is turned on and using the right input, and if the Google Home understands what we are asking for. Also (more usefully) it allows us to stream content from phones to the TV. Since the TV itself had a very limited suite of apps, this function is extremely useful. It had zero problem connecting the TV to the devices in our home, even the one iphone in our mostly-android household.
1206	Kumar	5	Very good	This new Chromecast is great.The setup was quick and painless and much easier to use.The quality of video and sound is great.One can cast videos from YouTube, Netflix and others and that is nice.
1207	Linkage	5	Works great	I have 4 of them. All work great! Have not had an issue with any of them.
1208	Mickey2423	5	Best Streamer	Its Honestly the best thing I have bought ! Works great with any smart phone ! Makes my TV smart and I use it on a daily basis when I want to watch Netflix or anything on the big screen ! Need to buy a couple more of them ! Love it !

1212	JoseJuan	5	Cast!	No need to hook my computer display to my TV. Everything I want to watch from my phone easily cast to my TV.
1213	Medavid16	5	Low expectations	Low expectations, pleasantly surprised. It is only 1080p, keep that in mind, but I'm using this on an older TV in the gym, works flawlessly. SLIGHT video/desktop latency delay, but the audio catches up and can't really tell otherwise. amazing for the price
1214	Tommy	4	It’s coo	It’s good product Would buy again very nice thing!
1215	Brian	5	Chromecast	I don't have smart a TV, Chromecast allows my TV to use streaming services. Really like it.

1217	aFauxhawk	5	Chromecast	Easy to use, you can send from all devices including laptop
1218	simplytrini88	5	Great Device	Great Device that lets you connect all your smart devices and stream to your television
1219	DaShortie	5	Great for travel!	Purchased this for hotel use. Works as it should work.
1220	Jp001	4	Easy setup	Easy to turn any TV to have Smart TV capabilities using a smartphone. I have one for each of my five TVs and they work great. For those who are less technology-savvy, I would recommend a Roku as the platform can be controlled with a remote. Both are about the same price. I gave it four stars as it is more difficult to use than the Roku and there have been some technical glitches when trying to stream.
1221	Btrevino	5	Great little gadget	Didn’t know what to expect purchasing this. Originally went in store to purchase a similar device. Bought this instead. Half the price and works great. I have I phone and practically works with every app. Step by step setup. Fairly easy to install. Highly recommended
1222	Tony	5	Great product overall.	Great product overall. Easy to use. Great streaming tool.
1223	Drake	5	Just Works	While this is by no means an all in one solution, when used the way it was intended it just works and works beautifully.
1224	NetworkCommander	4	Can now cast to older Samsung TV	For $35 (at the time) I am now able to cast videos and sports events from my more current tablet and phone to my older TV. Works great!
1225	Dorito	4	Works good	I use it daily. Works better than the built in cast on my Vizio which sucks and never works.
1226	Fauxhawk	5	Chromecast	It was a perfect gift for my father, he has enjoyed it very much
1227	gpuck	4	Not necessary but good alternative	Just another option for my Google home and my Harmony. So it's not necessary but gives me options.
1228	Budgetcard	5	Great deal	Best deal going for ditching cable. Many options for services
1229	ChrisfromPA	5	Good device	The chromecast does what I need it to do. I download a lot of google play movies, and I would like to watch them on my TV. This device is perfect for it. It was very easy to set up, and it works flawlessly. So far I have streamed Netflix, Youtube, Google Play Movies, and Google Play Music to my TV.
1230	GoldenBuy	5	Excellent Device	Wow, Technology! An amazing and interesting device and so easy to use!
1231	Louis	5	Works Great!	Bought this for a projector in my basement to watch sports while working out. I have directv so I have access to most apps, which I can find almost any major sporting event on one of the apps. It’s easy to set up and get started. You need your phone to work it but once it starts casting you can do other things like play music on your phone. Not sure if I would love it if it were my only source of TV, but is great as a supplement.
1232	Kennyg	1	Had to return it.	Man behind me in the line had the same problem. They have changed the Chromcast. It only works with Google.
1233	minime	5	great	I cut the cable and couldn't be happier, savings are significant
1234	Randy	5	Chromcast is great	I use my chromcast to stream Netflix, Hulu, and Vudu from my phone or tablet. It can allow you to cut the cord for good.
1235	TGG123	2	Not impressed	Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn’t. Returned the product.
1236	Bill	5	Works Great	This product work great through out the whole house.
1237	JElliott720	5	Google - Chromecast	This version of the product is easier than the original to setup. Great product at a very good price
1238	Beto	4	Works fine	For the price is a good device, works fine but no big difference with the older model
1239	ht0473	3	Fussy	Not a bad product at all - far more advanced than the old “cast” from PC only systems, but fussy. Needlessly fussy and of course, Android-centric.
1240	emosan	3	Google chromecast Black	Casting is good if you're casting directly from google and Xfinity. Was trying to cast from Windows Media Player on laptop to TV using Google Chrome and images are delayed and sound is choppy. Very difficult to cast Sound Spectrum images from Media Player and once succeeded, images and sound were also choppy and delayed. Not very smooth and not really happy since the whole reason for purchase was to cast media player/ sound spectrum images.

1251	anarchistfilms	4	Great for streaming on a non smart tv	This thing is great for screen casting on a regular non smart TV. Only real problem I have with it is that it requires a WiFi connection to work. I would prefer if it was able to simply connect to my device as I have terrible internet service in my area so often it is a useless chunk of plastic. Great for all of you guys with plenty of high speed internet service

We like several things on You Tube (such as cooking, sermons, ""how tos"" on skiing--golf--watercolor--and Claire and the Crosbys!) Sometime we will explore the other features. For now, I am so glad that it is easy to use, and know ahead that you have to get an app and work with the instructions a bit."

1337	GataScout	4	Make any TV smart!!	I love it... I use it all the time.. the only con.. I don’t know if it’s my iPad, the WiFi signal or the chrome.. but sometimes they just don’t recognize each other.. they forget the network or just don’t see the chrome in the iPad.. many times I have to shut everything for a while for it to work properly... then once it works it’s awesome...
1338	CW17	5	Love this thing!	I had an older TV in my bedroom that at one point I was contemplating replacing with a newer smartTV. But with the Chromecast, it got rid of that desire. I can just cast any Netflix or YouTube videos I want to watch or cast some music. It makes an old TV into a smartTV
1339	hannahr13	5	Amazing device	This device is great for putting Netflix onto my TV. I just use my voice to play any show or movie. I do wish I could choose which episode and that Hulu was able to use via voice, but overall it is great. It works great too!
1340	Mevrowka	4	Super easy to install and use but....	Found Netflix (and general internet) was slowing to a crawl after a while and constantly buffering. Thought about what I'd recently changed and the only thing that came to mind was I installed Chromecast. Rebooting my modem and adapter corrected the bandwidth issue for a few hours, but in the morning I'd be back to having little bandwidth. Tried unplugging Chromecast and no longer have any issues. I only plug it in when I want to use it - leave it unplugged when not in use. Works fine that way.

1362	JoJa	4	Good but slightly annoying	works to stream from phone but randomly tries to connect to phone every now and then

1409	Laurel	5	works great	I purchased these items for my bedroom. very happy with my purchase.
1410	LouV68	5	Very versatile little device	"I was a skeptic prior to using it, as I wanted a streaming box with apps built-in, but was I proven wrong! I picked one up and have been very happy since. It has streamed flawlessly from a few android phone apps I've tried - VUDU, Movies Anywhere, Youtube, Google Movies & TV, Amazon Video and a few others. It also streams what you have on your phone flawlessly, with no lag or judder (jerkiness). It was very easy to setup and start using. Highly recommended from a former skeptic.

NOTE: do not compare this to Casting/Mirroring off your phone directly to another capable device like a Smart TV or Blu-ray player. I have tried that feature, and it pales in comparison to using a Chromecast. Without a Chromecast, you will experience a lot of buffering, and unwatchable jerky video. This unit is worth every penny."
1411	Tony	5	Great!	Great purchase! The product works great! The staff was helpful!
1412	Carmicheal	4	Like it	It doesn’t do what I wanted it to do but it is still a great product that is why I decided to keep it

1417	LynLyn	5	Love this thingy	My son has one and bought it for me since I only have cable in one room. This is so awesome. I can pick up on my fave shows while eating chips in my bed. Kidding. Great product.
1418	Azil5967	4	Great option for streaming	This is a versatile streaming device that works seamlessly with Google products such as: google chrome, Google home, and android devices. Whats neat is asking google home to play content via voice. Having that linked is an awesome handsfree option. When home, nothing beats not having to always be on your mobile device or tablet, speaking to google home to cast to the google chromecast is worth it.
1419	Joanne	5	Will get another one	This works great! Allows me to watch movies with the family. Needs good WiFi in order to not buffer.
1420	Gregg	5	Great	Love this item, best for streaming!!! I would recommend this for anyone!

1424	Charisma	5	Good Stuff	Item seems a little over priced, so I could only justify buying it with a coupon and gift card. Good product, sleek look, does what it states. I had some issues setting up and syncing with my television, but everything worked after a complete shut down and reboot. Haven't had any problems/glitches since purchase and installation (approx. 1 month now).
1425	MSJCJ	5	Great product. I have 3	Works great for watching You Tube videos. I have one in 3 rooms in my home.
1426	Brian62	5	Works as described	"I use it all the time.

1427	twinsfannd	5	no brainer	"I have three of these now. Easy to set up, and use. I use it mainly for ESPN 3 which you still need your cable provider to offer. also youtube
 from your phone is nice."
1428	crespen	5	Chromecast - perfect screen casting!	"I love this device for casting my phone screen. The only limitation I find is when I cast from my iPad, which doesn't allow screen casting like my Android device does.

So 99.9% of my casting is via my Note 8."
1429	Luvblu	5	Easy Use	The connection of the Google Chrome was simple. It immediately connected to my Google Home Mini and I’ve had no issues.
1430	david	4	great value	should come with a carrying case otherwise easy to use

1441	Jack	5	Awesome never owned one before but easy to use	Bought it a while back and decided to do a review on it and it works great no trouble setting up and to cast something so far no trouble I use it to show movies or when doing school work.
1442	Bender76	5	Great price!!!	If you’re looking to cut the cord, this will definitely help. You can get Netflix and other streaming services, as well as cast from your phone to your tv. It’s great.
1443	JohnB	5	Great way to access your HDMI TV	"I'm more of a ""google"" than ""Apple"" guy and this works well with all my other Google products"
1444	Movies	5	great	works great good value for the price would recommend highly
1445	psmith	4	Good connection	This works well with the Wi-Fi connection and is more reliable than my fire stick. Only thing I do not like is that I have to 'cast' to it in order to utilize it. So, I have to turn my phone's Wi-Fi on, cast something to it, then turn my Wi-Fi back off on the phone. Also, I am probably not using the full potential of this device since I don't hardly know everything that can be cast to it.
1446	jmac99	5	Nice product	Excellent for streaming. Easy to set up. Great value.
1447	Steve55	5	Google Chromecast	Works great, we use are smartphone as a remote to play, pause, or adjust the volume.

1458	Crissey	4	Very Easy	I was able to install within a few minutes. It works well with my Apple devices. The only challenge I’ve experienced is when our WiFi in the home is too slow. Then it buffers.
1459	Aaadawg11	4	It's pretty good	I really like it, the only thing I don't like is some other device must be on in order for it to work.... but on the other hand it's Awesome to mirror my computer and phone. So it's kind of a trade off.
1460	chuck	5	Good	Ok to good. Can't use it in hotel. Good for home network.

1481	KevSlider	5	Great device, easy setup.	Syncs with Google home and your other Google devices with ease. Able to watch Netflix and other services.
1482	NotNow	4	Amazing if you have good wifi	"I absolutely love this product. I have two in the house one is pretty close to the router and the other is a bit far away. The one that is far away sometimes cuts off in the middle of something. 
I love that I can stream anything to my TV from my phone or tablet it is extremely convenient. My favorite feature is using my phone as a volume control. I did not realize how nice that would be. I have recommended this to multiple friends and family members I think it is well worth the cost."
1483	RajbPodder2018	4	Excelent	The casting of Youtube seems nice along with mobile content sharing but the desktop Chrome browser sharing seems lack of Audio
1484	David	5	Great to be used with Google Home and streaming	I got a Google Home Mini on Christmas so I decided to buy Google Chromecast to enhance my home automation system. Google Chromcast is easy to install and to operate. Basically it needs to be connected to your TV and enter a code to pair devices and you're set.

I just tell her to turn on my favorite show, better than a remote! Easy Install & Set Up."

1503	hockeypups	5	Should have gotten sooner	Simple and must have. I have an AppleTV, Roku and Fire Stick....this stumps them all! Instead of using an app on AppleTV, and then another on Roku, or FireStick for compatible issues with cable/service provider, this simplifies it.
1504	Kenyon	5	LOVE	I love my Google Chromecast! It is very easy to setup and I can move it from my t.v.'s. It is very easy to use and very useful.
1505	VectorJoe	4	Great tool to cast when using non-smart tvs.	This is a great tool to use to cast your computer or phone to a non-smart TV. The only thing I wish is that it would work easily with a direct connection to the Chromecast instead of through wifi. But still great.
1506	Willis	5	Purchased as a Gift for my Aunt!	Love that I am able to broadcast movies from my laptop onto the TV!
1507	bbmadw	5	Easy peasy	So easy to install. Up and running in less than 3 min. Highly recommended.

1511	intercepter	5	My crome cast is better than i expected to be.	I am enjoying myself, it is very easy to use, thank U.
1512	bestbuyer	5	So Good that I bought my friends one too!	"I purchased an Alexa echo and echo dot before and I loved both. So when I bought the google Mini Home, I had high expectations for the late-comer. However, I was blown away by the volume that this small device has and the creativity behind the tech that I had to buy my friends one for their birthdays and Christmas. Translates, reads audiobooks, plays music, weather, news, you name it...It even plays water noises and animal noises. One thing that I would improve is that the volume gets so high that it sometimes can't hear you call it, and you have to find a space in the loud music to scream ""OK google!"" for it to hear your demand, but other than that Google did this device right."
1513	Rose	1	Not user friendly	Bought it for my husband as an alternate source but was never able to use it.
1514	Daniely	5	cheap device for mobile casting	It's a really google hardware for casting if you have complete google ecosystem
1515	Ms0Allie	5	Make any TV a smart TV	A much cheaper alternative to buying a new smart tv. It works great and integrated well with my Google Home.
1516	ManishB	5	Easy to use product	"This is a very easy to use product. Fun to cast videos too. If you have a Google phone like the nexus/Pixel you can cast your whole screen and that is awesome. I wish google had also made it Miracast compatible so other phones could have done that too.
Works great with a Google home device to cast videos to.
I do miss a standalone remote though and wish it had an interface like a Roku. That's sometimes useful when you done want to operate a phone."
1517	BBReview	5	Google Chromecast purchase or not?	If you aren't sure whether to purchase Google Chromecast it is worth a second look and the price is reasonable
1518	TazJMT	4	Good with Google Home	"This is your standard ""try to not have to pay a cable bill"" item. But if you have a google home or google home mini, there are some cool voice features that make it fun"
1519	Jay1205	4	Great product for connecting your device to tv	I normally hook up my laptop to my tv to watch Youtube and other sites for entertainment but now that I disconnected my laptop, this is a great replacement.

1521	Judy	5	nice way to view hulu and netflix on tv	I'm still learning all it can do, but I'm happy that I can watch shows and movies not available on tv quite easily.
1522	Scuba	4	Works for most things on my ipad	It’s nice to watch internet shows on the TV! However, we wanted to watch small college basketball that is streamed and it wasn’t available.
1523	daisy1	5	Love it!	I started using Pure Flix, but my Samsung TV wouldn't download the app. Looking for another option, I considered a cord connecting the TV to my tablet that had the app on it. Fortunately, a friendly sales representative suggested getting the Chromecast. I was hesitant at first, but I'm so happy I purchased it! It is very convenient and takes little effort to play something on my TV from my tablet or phone. It's a wonderful solution and I don't have to deal with cumbersome cords!
1524	CubCadet2182	4	Great device to get on YouTube	This is a really good device to get on YouTube. It would be a good additive to a Google home.

1526	Mike	5	Great way to watch Movies and show on TV.	This little device works very well to stream movies and TV series on a TV at a very low cost. It is very easy to setup and use. I highly recommend it.
1527	Busstavo83	5	Perfect addition to any TV	In a day and age of smart devices; specifically smart TVs, the Chromecast can allow one to make non smart TV become smart through one's smartphone, tablet or chromebook. Add in the ability to cast content from those devices and one can't beat the value.
1528	BOBO1954	5	Works great on my kitchen TV	I bought this to connect my cell phone movies onto my kitchen TV. Works beautiful.
1529	Cosmin	5	Easy to use casting device	Works well with your google home or can just use it with the app on your phone- cast everything from your mobile device to a tv with the cast plugged in.

1540	Howard	5	All the video I want in one place.	Easy to set up and easy to use. Nice and small, easy to hide from view. No long wires. Connects easily to my Samsung Galaxy S8.
1541	Joseph	4	Good purchase.	Wish it had hulu built in like it does Netflix so I don't have to cast from my mobile device. Would be nice to ask Google to play a show from hulu not just Netflix.
1542	1026	5	Great	Appears to do as it says. Recommend this product as I’ve had no problems.
1543	Rick	5	Turns a normal TV into a Smart one.	Purchased the Chromecast for a friend whose 1st gen SmartTV stopped receiving support. The device has worked great and there is no complain. It is versatile to work with a wide variety of devices.

1581	Aaron	5	Great	Really enjoyed would defenetly recomend to a friend
1582	GamerOne	5	Small, easy to use device	"Decided to buy the chromecast to complement my google home mini speaker.

Setup was a breeze, just plug in the chromecast to a HDMI port, then you use your browser to get your chromecast connected to your wifi network.

Casting to the chromecast is also very easy. You just use a supported app (youtube for example) and hit the cast button and choose the chromecast and it will appear on your TV.

You can also use any of the google home speakers to control the chromecast via voice control, which works very well with google play music, which is another app you can cast to the chromecast.

All in all, this device works well, it is very easy to setup and use."

1596	Paul	5	Happy	Now I can cast from phone or iPad to the tv easily.
1597	Goofy1977	3	sounded better than it was	I thought this would be better than the amazon fire stick because you use your phone instead of another remote, it was very annoying to do the set up every time.
1598	Nina	5	Easy to Use	bought this for my mother to stream netflix and she loves it! she takes it everywhere because it is just that small and easy to set up
1599	sqjy	5	very easy to use	Very easy to use. Can be redirected connect with youtube.
1600	Frank	5	Great value	Love this I am able to cast from my phone to my TV with the push of a button. Great for most major platforms.
1601	Dawn	4	Works as expected	I received the Chromecast as a gift and ended up returning it. It did exactly what it was supposed to, let me access Netflix and other movie sites, however I felt like the Firestick had more features I would use, esp. the ability to cast your phone screen. I know the Chromecast can cast certain websites, but I wanted to cast my gallery...if the Chromecast can do that I guess I just couldn't figure it out, hence 4 stars instead of 5.
1602	SPLASH	4	Airplay for Andriods	Give it an A+ for being able to send my screen to a desired tv. Wish you could share whatever was on your phone, but its limited to some apps.
1603	CREZ999	5	Great Device	Big upgrade in connectivity reliability. Very happy with this product.
1604	Raph	5	Great ipad	"I purchased this 
newest generation iPad for my wife to replace one that was stolen from her. It is very fast and has all of the features that she wanted. It was a great price and was everything that I had hoped for."
1605	Chromecast	5	Better than a Firestick!	My son LOVES the Chromecast! I think he has retired his Firestick!
1606	cmfarris	5	AAA+	Makes getting on Netflix so easy and the picture is awesome!
1607	Bull123	5	works great	Great product. Gave for a gift and he really liked it.
1608	Chas	4	Works great	I purchased the Chromecast primarily to cast from my kinetic trainer. I find it very useful to cast video and music from my tablet as well. Many great features within this product.
1609	Jennyqt	5	I love	"Been using it everyday. I love it
Installing is very easy."
1610	Raghu	5	Great for streaming	This is a very good device form google for streaming your favorite programs.
1611	Stephanie	5	Works great with google home	We use this in coordination with our google home and love it. Looking forward to adding The Chromecast ultra to our home too.
1612	Jimm	3	Functional	I already have an Apple TV, so I didn't really need a streaming device. I thought I could use this with my google home to control my tv. It doesn't really do that. It will turn your tv on and select the source that is connected to chromecast, but you can't control volume or select other sources. To do that you'll probably need the logitech smart remote. I really don't care for the controls of the chromecast. Apple TV has a more user friendly layout. Since I have no use for it, I gave it to my Dad. He'll be able to use it to stream youtube and amazon prime from his computer to his tv in his barn.
1613	Jeremy	4	Fast, cheap smart TV	I bought this for my brother and sister-in-law (who I live with). They have found it to be a significant improvement over streaming through a blue ray player.
1614	WoodyWoodpecker	4	Works well	Would like to see a definitive security app. Not just assurances.
1615	Jcon77	5	Fantastic Purchase	Picked up the Chromecast to pair with my new Samsung tablet. Chromecast is effortless to set up and works perfectly. Highly recommended.
1616	vmcvod	5	Amazing!!!	This is our first streaming device. What an amazing technology.We just love it!!!
1617	Richard	4	Few Instructions	I am slowly learning how to use it. I was expecting something more like ROKU. But I am learning by trial and error.
1618	PopPop	5	Simple to use	Solved my problem of excessive buffering of streaming video from my PC. Casting video from my iphone to my TV is simple, easy and with outstandingly clear video. Very pleased.
1619	Brent	5	Casting works really well.	Casting is a very handy feature and makes TV watching very simple, especially when choosing content from your mobile device.
1620	Chromecastdiva	5	Best way to watch TV!!	The Chromecast is really the best way to watch TV, using your smartphone as remote-control. I love it!!!
1621	WAEVE23	5	Great	Easy to set up. Works great, and love all the apps.
1622	Sway	5	Nice addon to any TV!	Don't have a smart TV at home so this is the 2nd one we bought since they make a TV full use. Nowadays most of the content my family watches is on the internet so the chromecast is an easy addition to our TV's. Works really well with google home!
1623	MRBOOBOO1128	5	GREAT GOOGLE-CHROMECAST	FAST AND CONSISTENT.SIMPLE TO INSTALL AND EASY TO SETUP . WORKS WITH WIFI OR ETHERNET. NOW I DON’T EVEN NEED TO TOUCH THE REMOTE TO TURN OFF THE TV OR CHANGE.
1624	GadgetRevue	5	Oldie but goodie.	Same as the original model from a feed back but why change something that works. Like the simplicity and video quality but again wished for a remote controller or HDMI control to make more TV surfng friendly.
1625	Misra	4	Nice gadget	I found a really good gadget to share content with you vr tv or display, plus you can share your computer sreen with no cables...
1626	bestbuyreviewer	4	Chromecast	It works just as it is intended. Easy to hook up but requires phone to download and support app to cast to your TV. You better have a big memory phone to make it work better.
1627	Biffjerquee	3	I've barely used it so far.	"I've barely used it so far. Bought it in conjunction with purchase of Google Home device, and have only used Chromecast to ""cast"" music from Google Home to my tv 5.1 sound system. Lot of exploring left to do."
1628	Joseph	5	Great product	Easy to use and your able to travel with it on vacation.
1629	klimmr	4	works as advertised	YoutubeTV was the deciding factor and this works great!
1630	Smileyjacksonscorpio1031	5	loving it.....	great buy. always at best buy for television, audio accessories. next working on purchasing some more SONOS awesome.....
1631	Adam	5	great with google home and a phone or tablet	Chromecast has more and more apps that can cast from the phone, a tablet, or a computer. It is really simple to use. With a google home, and a Netflix account, you can tell google to cast a movie or show, and it plays automatically.
1632	Risu	5	Fantastic for any TV with HDMI	You just connect it, get the google home app on your phone, finish setup, and thats it. You can stream anything on your phone you want played on the big screen and if you have a google home you can pair it with the chromecast and tell it to play shows, movies, etc from netflix, youtube, or hulu so long as you have a subscription to any of those that it applies to.
1633	AlexJohnson	5	Wireless Presentation!	I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner, but this is the perfect solution for wireless presentation in our office conference rooms. No need to plug anything in. No need for equipment on the table. Just turn on the TV and connect. So easy!
1634	loncho02	5	Great product	I love it, you dont need to buy a smart tv and its easy to install
1635	Nathaniel	5	watch anything	Really enjoy the Chromecast. This is the second one we have purchased. Got rid of cable, and now we can watch anything we want anytime we want. Casting it right from our phones.
1636	Saikrishna	5	Smart Google Chromecast	It makes life easy in turning on TV and turning off. Easy to cast songs, movies on TV.
1637	Unclebush	5	Product is ideal for purpose bought	Easy to install and use. Was bought for a remote area and exceeds expectations.
1638	Mara	5	Great device	At first it had a connectivity issue where it could randomly disconnect from the TV. But all that got fixed once I exchanged it. A+
1639	Realtor	3	Works ok but not great	Somethings it works when I ask it to change a channel on the TV but other times it dose not.
1640	FE48	3	Expanding scope of my Google Home	My son has used this without issue to control a tv. I am having some issues getting it set up, but expect success.
1641	tina88	5	I am enjoying it.	I recently switched to a Google phone which is why I decided to buy this. This is nice and streamlined product because you just need your phone to use it, (your phone is the remote). I also enjoy the promotions that the play store offers. If you are into the ultra 4k tvs, I don't think you need the ultra chromecast. If you have a basic and hd tv then this is perfect.
1642	mrsh	5	Works great	Converted from cable to Google TV this was critical
1643	Music	5	Great price	Affordable, not only easy to install it's easy to use.
1644	TaraAnn	5	Excellent	Love being able to cast music, movies, photos to my tv
1645	Lance	3	Good to cast from phone	Ok, but you have to use a phone along with the chromecast, which I find as a hassle and a burden on the phone battery. Much prefer the Amazon fire stick.
1646	Clock	4	Works great	Simple to install and works great. Price competitive.
1647	carl	2	Interface issues with chromecast	When I cast a video to my TV from my smartphone, there seems to be a periodic buffering issue. Sometime the video just prematurely ends in the middle etc..or elsewhere periodically. Not sure if the problem is wi fi, phone or the chromecast.
1648	Techwoman	5	ChromeCast	This is a cool device. It was easy to set up but it didn't connect at first. I called a Chrome Tech and his advice was very helpful. We've been enjoying big screen viewing of streaming shows ever since!
1649	GypsyRose	5	Good way to cast from a Chromebook	My boyfriend bought me a Chromebook for Christmas and I was like great I can stream movies and all kinds of stuff straight to my smart TV. Turns out Chromebook is weird and it's not that easy to do that if you have a Samsung TV, that's where the Chromecast comes in. This works great for casting all sorts of different things to the TV and this is the main reason that it was purchased, I haven't really gotten in there and used any of the different apps yet so I will have to try that out and update my review accordingly.
1650	Butterfele	4	It's Good	Super easy to install. I retuned it however because you have to download each app then cast it to your TV. But the product work exactly how it's supposed to, there's just another product that I think is better...shsssh the Firestick
1651	Memi	5	Great for screen mirror	Love it best purchase ever, won't regret it. You can stream everything from your phone.
1652	janha	5	good antenna	I like this. I bought this one in store as the price mark down for the open box. very good antenna. give very good picture
1653	Amelia	5	Great for Netflix/Hulu lovers!	This Chromecast is wonderful! I connect it from my phone to my TV and I can still use other apps while watching Netflix.
1654	KReed	5	Works without any glitches	No complaints. Recommend keeping it plugged in all the time for updates
1655	Dionne	5	Good purchase	This product was pretty simple to set up and works great.
1656	EMJ00	5	Easy to setup	Wish it could connect to hotel WiFi but other than that it’s a great item
1657	Maro	5	Great	My laptop didn't have an hdmi port so i couldn't attach that to mirror neither did it allow screen mirroring with my new Samsung tv but this Chromecast made it possible. The quality is great. I use it for screen mirroring and it works perfectly.
1658	Humbled7	5	Great product	It is awesome for mirroring what's on your phone and for apps.
1659	Mrsb	5	Great	Product is great and works like expected. Was given as a gift and recipient loves it.
1660	Motomom	5	Exactly what we needed	Great help in the store locating it, and it was at a great price
1661	Tidel68	4	Convenient.	Nice to be able to cast to your big without losing the ability to use your phone. Not a replacement for a Roku device though.
1662	WillEd	5	Works perfectly and easy to use	I bought the Chromecast on December last year and since then the product has worked perfectly for what is what meant for. Easy to use, I can stream a broad range of videos to my TV (Youtube, Netflix, PC). A very resourceful tool to think about. Highly recommend it.
1663	Rolo	5	Love this Product	I am amazed how well this works. I can use this product to watch Netflix, Youtube on my big screen casting from laptop, phone or tablet. So far the picture is very clear and crisp. I will be cutting the cord this year and happy that I purchased this to save me even more from the high cable bill.
1664	Frank	4	Works like a charm	"I love the flexibility of the unit and how I can project powerpoint presentations and video as well as photos from my camera etc...
I recommend this product to anybody that is in business for themselves or even for casual use."
1665	Casey19	5	Works great	Works great, allows me to stream things to the tv.
1666	Margie	5	Love it	After a long time of trying to get in hooked up... We really like it..
1667	Ploppy	5	Great Streaming Device	Easy set up. Good quality output. Mirrored my laptop screen with no delay and played a movie, no problems. Highly recommended.
1668	ViSa	4	Great product to use with google home	I mainly got this product for convenience to use with google home. I love it so far.
1669	Gene	5	Great Option for the Money	Chromecast is highly affordable and helps to cut the cord with the cable company. Plugged it in and worked in seconds!
1670	Mike	5	Works great	Much better than original. Setup was very easy!!!!
1671	Mom506	4	great sound	I bought this to replace another brand when sound was lost in one ear bud. The sound on the LG was great. It was clear and blocked out other sounds in my workout room.
1672	terp4life	5	Love the chrome cast	Love the device. It was very easy to set-up and has worked fairly flawlessly.
1673	ONE93	5	Works GREAT!!!	This just does everything it should be doing with no issues. The end :)
1674	Ikej	5	Great in the office	This was easy to setup on a smaller t v for office use
1675	Sati	5	Nice casting device	Had one already and loved it. Ordered one more for the second tv.
1676	Chris	5	Great Product	I had a tv with chromecast built in. This feature makes watching streaming media a breeze. You can pull up media on your phone or tablet and with a push of a button display on your tv. This chromecast device allows you to have this ability on any tv. Got this for our second tv in the home and love it!
1677	Jim1836	5	Great for streaming	Easy to install and good instructions to download app for use.
1678	Wendy	5	Great product	Works perfectly as described. We were worried about it slowing down our Internet but it doesn't. There is no lag.
1679	Smurphette	5	Great for streaming beachbody workouts	I got the google chromecast to stream Beachbody on demand workouts and it has been great for that
1680	katsquilt1	5	Great value	It a good product. I really like it. But it. Fun!!
1681	DaddyB	5	Bought for mother-in-law	So far this has been great. She had a smart Blu-ray player that became slow and unstable. Great solution for us!
1682	DJinSC	5	Great and Love It	Great device for intended use. Very easy set up and operation.
1683	JoeArg	5	Great product	I love it, is a great product and I would recommend it
1684	Acapo006	5	Cool item.	Chromecast is a cool piece of tech. It can be a bit flaky sometimes, but when it works, it works great.
1685	Edward	5	Great Gadget	I bought two of these for my house. They have been great. Especially once I bought a Google Home and I can tell my Google Home to play something on the chromecast.
1686	Icedevil	5	This is my 4th Chromecast, love them	Chromecast is absolutely invaluable to me. It is so versatile. You can cast many apps from your phone or just cast your phones screen for unsupported apps. You can also cast from your PC which is perfect. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
1687	Earl	5	This was a great item for us	This was a dream come true, I had no idea that the hold family was going 2 enjoy watch Netflix on the google chromecast
1688	TennTechMan	4	There are Two Models, 1080p & 4k	This Chromecast works great for streaming video from online sources. There are two models. A 1080p and a 4k model. Be sure to get the right one for your TV.
1689	Nikkaj	5	Good replacement	This is a good replacement for a cable box. Instead of paying monthly I just use the HBO and Showtime app and sign in with my cable account.
1690	drewy27	4	Good Product	Very good and easy to use. My wife and I will often Cast from our ipads or phones to the tv. Has done everything we have needed it to do so far. Only issue I am having, is when I stop casting, sometimes my tv volume does not work. I need to turn off my tv and turn back and on the volume returns. No idea what is causing this to happen?
1691	SportsGuy	4	Still Getting to Know	So far haven’t used it too often and am trying to see its advantages over the Amazon FireStick.
1692	WADJ	5	I love it!!!	This product is great! I absolutely love it! It is wonderful for binge watching my favorite shows and very easy to use.
1693	chikii	5	LOVING it	Its the best of the best if you're a netlix freak! or watch hulu. I can be bale to switch form one app to another I haven't had any issues yet except with one app (TUBI) which seems to not be recognized by google chrome and it keeps throwing a not connected message. It works great with youtube videos as well
1694	Alex	5	Great product	Great product. We use this to stream content to our standard (non-smart) tv.
1695	MasterFaiz	5	Great product, easy to use	Was a bit skeptical before purchasing as there were a few different competitors, like the fire stick, but this is great product and works pretty flawlessly.

1701	Jhelle	5	I love it!	You just need to know what it does and you will enjoy it!
1702	Sams3	4	Great streaming device.	I have been waiting for a product to come along that worked well enough for me to cut my cable cord and this along with its streaming platform s have made that possible. Great product!
1703	Denise	5	So far loving it!	So far I am loving this item. I was using a Firestick to access YouTube and needed a new option as of Jan. It is working well and I have access to all of the workouts I want.
1704	BD19	4	Great product	Easy to use! The installation is quick and easy going! Great if you have google home. Loading doesn’t take long either and the streaming is clear.
1705	Babaloo	5	Great Product	Its a great product for the price, its easy to use.
1706	Laptop	5	Good deal	I love this product is great is perfect for my family.
1707	ignaciomorales87	3	previous version seemed better	I have experiencied what seem to be memory problems with this devide, which hangs and gets restarted automatically....never happened with the previous version, which I also have. I was expecting better
1708	ALLA	5	it works	much faster than the first generation, but considering new offers from Roku and Amazon, this is definitely overpriced if you buy it at regular retail price.
1709	acctinatl	5	LOVE CASTING	The chromecast is a a great tool for casting. I also like that it integrates very well with Google Home.
1710	Chandra	5	Love playing from anywhere	It's a perfect thing to have on a projector. No wire to connect simple and easy with chrome to play whatever u like to play on the big screen.
1711	Jackwl	5	Great product for the price.	Works just as good as the Apple TV for streaming for only one third of the cost.
1712	Daaronclar	4	Great for not having cable	Got this so I could watch tv after I cancelled my cable. I'm very happy with the performance the streaming is smooth and I get all of the channels that I normally watched on cable. My house is next to a large hill that made antenna usage sluggish and in some cases unavailable. Now I get a nice picture using my wifi.
1713	aztraveling	1	Wouldn't connect to wifi	At a distance of 15 feet with 1 wall in the way it would not connect to wifi. At 3 feet it would connect through the same wall. To bad that wasnt where i was gonna use it, where it did connect. Returned.
1714	Mateo	4	Worth The Price	I bought this for my parents because the Apple TV was getting way to complicated to use and search for content. This is much easier to use and at a fraction of the cost.
1715	NeilBeats	5	Exceeds My expectations	This device has literally changed my life. I needed a device to screen cast all my devices and this is the best option. I am surprised it doesn't cost more.
1716	Rich	5	Such a useful item	Chrome cast is a great addition to making your home more device friendly. Easy to use.
1717	Perfecto	4	Good Gadget to have	It's very interesting now watching stuff on my TV for things that I normally watch on my computer. It;s much easier for my to see it with my fading eye sight
1718	Shaamim	5	Great	Stream music in every room of the house with Google Chromecast. Access over 100 apps to listen to your favorites anytime. Plus, you can use your smartphone as a remote to play, pause, or adjust the volume. And texts or calls won't interrupt the music.
1719	Themechanic06	5	Family entertainment	It's good to have one of these for family getaways.
1720	CablingNY	5	Recommended	Most recommended and useful gadget for everybody. I personally use it for tv.youtube.com what help me cut cable and enjoy all popular live tv channels.
1721	2013Salem	5	Great.	Allows me to watch YouTube on my tv. Glad to find it.
1722	Aimee	5	Totally amazed	We love being able to view our computer, lap top, phones and tablets on our big screen!
1723	JerryW	1	Can't even connect with Google Pixel 2 phone!	I have tried multiple such dongles with mixed results, none satisfying. So I take the final step to buy this Chromecast and pair it with a Pixel 2 phone. Both of the latest version. The setup works for Youtube, but can't do screen mirroring at all. It simply won't connect. I spent hours checking Google and online discussions, checked all settings, reset, reboot everything, nothing works. It's amazing how Google could do such thing! I'm wordless when my wife was laughing at me with her iPhone and Apple TV. Guess I will have no choice but to join the Apple eco system. Google has itself to blame to lose me, a long time android user. Someone will think I'm just incompetent in technology. All I can say is I`ve been writing codes before Google exists. This is a product flaw, period. You may get lucky, but make sure you can return your Google phone before you buy it. I'm only able to return the Chromecast. Sad.
1724	anna	5	Chromecast	Very easy to use. Can use your phone or the laptop
1725	gabinator	4	Easy to setup and use!	This is my 2nd Chromecast. I have a first gen model and this one was just as easy to set up and use as the first one. Highly recommended for streaming from Netflix or your laptop computer!
1726	MAC23Texans08G	3	Great external device for TV	This is great for casting items to the TV and mirroring items.
1727	RoboteGigante	5	Love my Chromecast	This has become the focal point when we’re home watching and listening to music videos with family. We actually fight over who gets to cast the next video :)
1728	TXKK626	1	Pointless	Fairly pointless if you have something else to stream through, like a smart TV, gaming unit, or Apple TV. Lack of user interface really decreases usability. It's mostly just a device to stream to your TV from a smart phone.
1729	BigOil	5	Easy to set up	This product is easy to set up and works flawlessly with other products.
1730	Nikki	5	chromecast streaming device	This device works so wonderful, and I just love it more everyday!
1731	pinky	5	very good	Nice device I love it.......................................................
1732	Chavis4life	5	Three's a charm	I purchased the Google home, google home mini and the chrome cast for my other half for Christmas and he loves all three. They are the perfect combination. With the chrome cast he can stream his shows and watch so many more. Worth every penny.

1738	JMonteiro	5	Easy to use	This is even better then my smart TV. It was easy to install and learn to use
1739	cjlarum	5	2nd one	we have one already, needed a 2nd one for the bedroom. does exactly what it should!
1740	Piepie59610	5	Works perfectly. No personal issues.	Very quick setup and very fast. Connects easily. Extremely efficient.
1741	Tinner	2	Returned item	Seemed to spend as much time buffering as it did properly casting a movie. Not sure if it was the units fault or my signal.
1742	mikee	3	it has some problems	can't get the audio to sync with the video. sound is sometimes 20-30 seconds behind the video. got a new newgear router, better, but not correct.
1743	Lovereviews	5	Excellent	Works great with Hulu Live TV and YouTube TVamd HBO
1744	wire	5	Awesome	Spread it works great for streaming anything from your phone walked right out of the box and no problems.
1745	DDubb	5	Chromecast is best for streaming movies & Music	This model of Chromecast is even better than the first one. It's great for binge watching on Netflix, and it offers many other streaming capabilities also. This product is worth the money you pay for it and more.
1746	GoProGuy	5	Very Easy to Use	I love this because it’s so easy to use. Not too many clicks involved with screen sharing.
1747	audionut	5	My 2nd chromecast	Works great - just make sure you have a strong wifi connection nearby so to make reliable casts.
1748	Cdojahn	5	Good	Great product, we do not have wifi so this did way more then we need. Ended up returning for the apple fire hdmi cord
1749	Kbear	4	Sadly no amazon	I wish i could cast my amazon. But i like that i am able to link my google home with it to control it. and no need for a remote either use a phone or voice which is nice.
1750	Paulo	5	Excellent product	Extremely easy to install and very self explanatory. Works great with tablets, iPhone and iPad.
1751	Frankie	5	Chromecast is an easy way to view Youtube on my TV	I like using my chromcast for viewing YouTube videos, and Netflix from my iPad, cellphone, or laptop by using my Bluetooth and WiFi together... it’s easy.
1752	Larry	5	Get away from cable	Great alternative to paying for cable and works with Google Home Mini. Talk to your TV and it listens.
1753	Wvgumdoc	5	Great cord cutter product	Recently cut the cord with Comcast TV service. This is a great, inexpensive, reliable product to allow you to stream content to your TV. Works flawlessly with DirecTv Now, and has some functionality with Google Home products.
1754	Shehab	5	Best seller	It’s the best thing if you use an LCD or LED, you all know how it goes but before going to buy it make sure you have the subscriptions to different apps.
1755	Ejp83	5	Everything in one spot	This is my favorite casting device. I love that I can cast anything on my phone to my TV.
1756	Tdtown	5	Have one on all my tv's	Chromecast is inexpensive and simple media stream device I har added to all my televisions
1757	Akll	4	Super easy set up	This thing is foolproof. Take it out of the box, hook it up to TV, and follow instructions to have it connect to home Wi-Fi. That's it. Only trouble is with Amazon prime, still figuring out a workaround.

1759	Rick	5	google devices	I have been happy with this item...google really puts out great products.
1760	partsguy	5	So easy	I started using you tube tv and I tried using an apple tv but it was a real pain in the neck. I picked up one of these and it is the easiest way to stream any content onto a tv. Very happy.
1761	Dang69	5	Works perfectly	Never have issues with it, runs well, does what it needs to on the cheap.
1762	Sciencerockgirl	5	Helpful device	It is great to be able to project images larger onto the tv screen.
1763	Mill	5	Great Chromecast	I had to learn how to set up the Chromecast. It was pretty simple to do on my own. I am really enjoying this Chromecast.

1767	Dude247	4	It works	Hard to set up, but after you get it going, it works well. Wish there was a way to make sure you're getting Dolby Digital.

1773	dushyant8858	5	Works perfect	The product is as per the description. Fast delivery.
1774	Donnie	5	Works great, easy to use	Easy to use... works great.. simple setup, just plug and play
1775	Caskett	5	New design, same service.	Chromecast has pretty much been a required device for every TV in your home since its initial release, and despite Amazon's insistance to prevent users from buying one and using their service with the Google Dongle, it is still the best streaming device on the market, especially at its price point.
1776	daBeagle	5	Great addition to Google home.	I bought a Google home over Christmas and I wanted to control my Tv's so I bought 2 of these. I can now ask Google home to turn on and off my TV. I also use Netflix and YouTube with it.
1777	dht1986	5	Great way to integrate tech into the living room	The Chromecast is extremely easy to set up, and works great with Android devices. Being able to cast your phone, internet, movies, YouTube, etc gives a whole new view onto tech in your life. Super easy to enjoy media content through the Google play store
1778	mercedhawk	2	Seems to create problems	We purchased the Chromecast because it is the only way to get YouTubeTV. Unfortunately, after getting set up and using it for a few hours it just stopped. Customer service went through all their protocols and finally scratched their head and said they didn't know what was wrong. Then I see an post from that says this product has a bug that causes it to mess up your wifi. Don't know when or how it will be fixed. In the meantime, find another product and use another service.
1779	Rob171979	5	great for watching movies	this was the best thing ever for watching movies an videos
1780	griffithgs	4	Good for streaming	I feel that I would use it alot more if you didn't have to keep changing the input source
1781	i009781	4	It does the job, performs well	The chromecast installs easily in an HDMI port, and works as advertised. No issues to date.

1783	VhElectronics	5	Excellent product	My first time to use this type and I feel very happy to use for its convenience. I now can use my note5 phone to control without looking for remote. Transfer speed and quality picture are good, no lagging. So far, very happy.
1784	Melvino	4	Good one	Good way to watch tv online pretty good electronic
1785	Donna	5	Must have	Must have for all living rooms. Helps stream videos
1786	King	4	Works great	I like this but wish that it had it's own menus and a remote
1787	Zebralady	5	Works well with Google Mini	Easy set up, nice addition to the google mini. Love being able to ask my mini to play a specific song on YouTube but on my living room TV
1788	Hometheaterbob	5	Works flawlessly	The product works flawlessly and will stream everything but Amazon. It can’t do Amazon because Amazon won’t allow it since Google is their competitor.
1789	Annie	4	Hardware & Media Products	"Hardware - plugged in and played right away. Control through cell phone was another matter. Took some effort and memory to load up cell phone. Control this way is not smooth.

Media Products - there are a LOT of useless movies, what a waste of time, talent, and resources and for what? In other words typical celebrity mindlessness, shallowness, and ego. Netflics and others do offer a few good movies, but app downloads for EACH provider into EACH controlling cell phone is necessary - ugh. Hard to tell if I would recommend product to others... probably with advice given here."
1790	mnkyby235	5	Easy peezy	Easy set up , simple to use. I highly suggest the chromecast.
1791	MommaZ	5	Delighted	To streamTV and music with a little device which was super easy to setup
1792	Xbri1999	4	Cheap way to stream to TV	Better value than Apple TV, and more flexible. Great value to turn am old TV into a streaming display for Netflix, Hulu etc
1793	Jordan	5	Nice product	I love it. It works very well and as intended. Hooked it up to my Google home mini
1794	Alex	5	Works good	Lags a bit on startup but after everything is loaded up it works great
1795	Alex	5	Great pair with Google home	"I bought this to use with my Google home. Works perfectly. Just say ""Google play -------- on Netflix"" and it plays. Awsome"
1796	InsertNickname	5	Solid all around	Easy to cast videos to my TV like nothing. I have a smart TV, but this works so much better.
1797	sammy	5	Google - Chromecast - Black	I received this as a Christmas gift and so far I really like it. It was easy to install..
1798	trillnye	5	Fast and excellent to use	Works quickly and much faster than gen 1. Highly recommend unless you're big in 4k, then get the ultra.
1799	sIlvana	2	Great idea but doesn’t work well	"I got the cromecast with google home, and so far it’s been a pain to use it. Most of the time, when I’m going to stream something from my phone I have to unplugged and plugged back in, also i have to turn off my phone data ( that’s what the guy a costumer service said when I called ). And most of the time it doesn’t show the opticion to connect to my tv on Netflix or YouTube because it can’t find it, I get tired and end up using my old fire stick. 
Is a great idea but I think they have to make a lot of improvement, I don’t recomend buying this also having no remote is annoying!!"
1800	Pete	3	Works as Advertised	I use this product with my iPhone. You need to have the apps you want to use on the phone to start with. Unlike the Apple TV or real smart TVs there is not selection of apps on the device you just stream from a phone to the cast. You kind of need to know what you want to watch as browsing just to see whats available isn't the same as with an Apple TV where you can just scroll through apps and whats recommended or being pushed by the app. Also the Google Home is great for pausing but playing and casting from the Home to the cast is hit or miss. Picture quality is good, its not 4k obviously but neither is my TV so not really the cast's fault.
1801	Bonco0912	5	Made an old Samsung Smart.	This works perfect on an old Samsung. Kids love it! Made the 8 yr old TV a smart TV for under $50!
1802	BeaBea	5	I love it	"This is one of my favorite items in my house it's easy to use n so convenient! 

Click,Stream and enjoy!"
1803	Bran	5	Great and easy	Easy to set up and use! Love it! Can’t wait to get other tvs hooked up
1804	EmlMhc	5	Wonderful	Make watching shows, on a tv that has no Blueray or DVD player and is not a smart tv, really way with our phones.
1805	CHINNA	5	EXCELLENT	"IT IS GOOD AWESOME EXCELLENT . I LIKED IT 

THANK U"
1806	punchNPie	5	Easy way to share a screen	Simple and works. Can watch videos easily from my phone to my TV. Works better than the built in TV apps for my smart TV.
1807	Mikel	5	Works Great	"Purchased this on Black Friday weekend along with a Google Home for my college dorm. After linking both to my account on the Google Home app, I can use the Google Home to play videos, music, etc on the projector. Definitely worth it! I like that I don't have to be on the same wifi network as the device to control it from the google assistant.

Disclaimer for college students: Make sure these are supported on your campus if getting one for your dorm! My IT department doesn't support them and I had to find a roundabout way to get it working myself."
1808	Crunch6	5	My baby	I don't I have cable I have wifi and with Chromecast I can watch anything I want at anytime
1809	Dishinitout	5	Love Chromecast	"Works great and super easy to set up. Very portable.
Whats not to like ?"
1810	Loring	5	new functionality for my TV watching	"I like these chromecasts, they allow me to send a lot of content from my PCs to my TVs. I only recently discovered these, and how they work although I'd heard of them.
If you have a very recent TV, it may already have an alternate casting technology - I also discovered that when I was getting ready to add it to my new 4K TV... I found the new TV already on the list of castable TVs. So check your TVs before you buy!"
1811	Tyler	5	Easy and reliable	Chromecast is easy to setup, easy to use and very reliable!
1812	TonyTJ	4	GREAT OPTION TO STREAM THINGS TO TV	ITS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT IN TIMES IS SOME SLOW TO STREAM THINGS, MAYBE IS MY INTERNET CONNECTION OR THE INSANE HEAT OF THE PRODUCT
1813	davegar	5	Good performance for low price	Had a previous generation Chromecast that would occasionally freeze up when casting Spotify or Netflix. This one has worked much better and can take advantage of 5GHz wifi.
1814	DonS	5	Worked as expected.	easily plugged into my TV and connected easliy to the google home.
1815	Joekam12	5	Quick fix	This is great it makes streaming on my bedroom tv so easy. As an added bonus it works with my Google home
1816	Sungsam	4	Great	I love it. I am able to use my Google Home Mini to control it, which makes things easier.
1817	rooster52	3	checking it out	I got a google home mini for Christmas and read how it could control my TV and connect to my Netflix account. I product does work with he the TV...but because the TV is an older model 2012...it does not control a lot of the TV functions (which appears to be the TV manufactures fault of not supporting a standard CEC operations. only weird thing to me is all functions are controlled by a phone or tablet...not bad just different
1818	DDubya	4	Works well	Nice to have when traveling outside of home. Worth the $$.
1819	Timmy	4	Much Better Than 1st Gen	We also own a 1st Generation Chromecast and decided to try this one when the original had issues staying connected to our home network. Setup was very easy and we have had no issues with connectivity or lagging. Works great with PCs, tablets and phones.
1820	chewy	4	Great sale	I got these chrome cast for $20 each. It is good for the people I bought them for who don't have smart tv's and really don't watch a lot of tv anyways.
1821	Tomhy	5	Great device but limited	You can only cast programs to the device. Works well but always need another device to cast from.
1822	Guzman	5	Best $35 investments: invisible and always there	Attached to the back of my TV set on a HDMI port, it is invisible. Moreover, since there is no remote to control it, it is always ready to be used. We were first given the Chromecast as a gift. Since then we have bought a second one for a second TV set, and given several of them as gifts to family members.
1823	Al12345	5	Good product!	Just got perfectly for what I need. And the connect is great.
1824	Sujatha	4	Good One	Got it on thanks giving offer...User friendly. Good one
1825	Chri55y	5	Great	Works great with my google home , love I can watch all my stuff in one place
1826	worm	5	Great product	The new design makes it less likely to break. The only draw back is the few times it wouldn't connect, but that seldom happens.
1827	Sunshine	5	Great Product.	Easy installation. Clear streaming. Very satisfied with device.
1828	Brynn	4	Works great	Easy to use and convenient. No need to upgrade bedroom tv.
1829	Nascargtp	4	Works as described	Gave as a gift and have not heard any complaints. Seems to work as described.

1831	333brett	5	"Very simple ""plug and watch"" capability"	Very easy to install and get started watching shows from computer or smartphone.
1832	Samy	5	Better than the last version	We bought this because our last Chromecast got squished and broke. This is way better than the last version of Chromecast and updates itself!
1833	JosephJr	5	Great for streaming	I stream everything. I've used chromecast for several years now and I have no complaints. It's dependable and fast I recommend it.
1834	fredodz	5	Great Streaming Device	Chromecast works with any device.Easy to send videos and pictures to your tv
1835	HardCharger	5	Bought 2nd for home	Love the item so much had to buy a second to use....
1836	LinnG	4	Love it!	"I love having a Chromecast on the TV - I love being able to ask for Netflix or Youtube with just my voice and start to watch something I requested. I liked it so much, I bought another one for my bedroom TV.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the picture is not as clear as when I go through my Apple TV - I hope they fix this in the future. Overall I'm very pleased."
1837	Jk944	5	Great for casting from smart phone to Tv	We use chromecast on both our TVs very easy to use and setup great for casting shows and music to tv
1838	AAAA	5	Good quality for the price	I liked this product because it makes it easier to watch shows and programs from my phone onto my tv!
1839	ashmamula	5	Yes Yes Yes	Bought this on black friday for our living room tv. GREAT alternative to cable as you can stream literally anything from your phone.

1847	imthdj2u	5	works great	definitely must have especially if your tv isn't a smart tv
1848	Kmats23	5	Easy to use and easy set up	Very easy set up and very easy to use. Screen mirroring from your cell or your tablet! Awesome product!
1849	LeetLeet	5	Great substitute for a smart tv	I love my google chromecast. I use it in conjunction with my Samsung tablet and can stream almost anything. I often use the google home app to mirror-cast my tablet screen to the tv, and stream from there. Or, if what I want to watch is available in a chromecast compatible app (which almost every streaming app is), I just cast directly from the app. I’ve purchased multiple chromecasts. I think it’s safe to say I have a slight affinity for it lol.
1850	XRay	5	Does What it needs to	Streams your phone's media or computer screen to your TV
1851	scanchecker	5	Google - Chromecast - Black	"Google - Chromecast - Black
This statement by Google about the Google - Chromecast is true: ""Stream music in every room of the house with Google Chromecast. Access over 100 apps to listen to your favorites anytime. Plus, you can use your smartphone as a remote to play, pause, or adjust the volume. And texts or calls won't interrupt the music."""
1852	Culligan	5	Fantastic	"Excellent technology-
Works great with YouTube TV
Cancel Dish and subscribe to YouTubeTv only 35 per month"

1855	LIFE408	5	Perfect!	Was a perfect grit for a family member they loved it, and the employees really helped out, thanks best buy.
1856	Sam19	5	Very handy	Love all the compatible apps small and low profile
1857	RYANB1	5	Works Well	Nice unit we like it.. in some aspects nicer to stream phone content than roku, does require usb power source though (which many tv's have anyway)
1858	Lizm	5	Cool device	Love my new google chromecast. I’m able to watch everything on the go
1859	Nick	5	Goggle Chromecast work	This product is very good, it really does the job that was designed for.
1860	Sunny143	5	Chromecast 2	I purchased this item on sale so we can watch what is on tablet or phone on television. I did a lot of research before hand to understand the ease of use and set up. Very happy with it and it works well.
1861	Nic209	5	Love the Speed when conecting!!!	"Just upgraded to this new chromecast , I have 2 2nd G and now this one 3G , I like how conects and cast videos , some apps contens to my TV ! 
Totally recommend this divice !"
1862	Serg	4	Works great.	Make sure you have a good router and a good connection to the internet to stream media. You have to buy the app in the on Apple devices. And Apple TV works better with Apple devices.
1863	BLee	5	Simple and reliable	The Chromecast works very well with Note 8, never had a single issue with it.
1864	Businessmanupnorth	5	Great value	The Chromecast is a great value. Simple addition to have access to watch media from Hulu, Netflix, etc on your TV!

1866	Maxi11	5	Loveeee it!	I have tried amazon fire stick and for sure i stay with chromecast, its easier to use, and u can mirror all u want, computer, ipad, iphone, any cellphone
1867	vsp900	5	Love my Chromecast	This is an awesome little device. It took me a while to figure out I had to be on the same wifi network as the master device, but once I realized that, this thing works perfectly.
1868	Sakruvala	5	Excellent product	This is an amazing product. It is so efficient, easy to handle and can be carried anywhere and everywhere.
1869	Sabino415promemer	5	Amazing	I bought this after my first chromecast broke & its been way better! Videos load faster it boots up quicker overall superior product. Highly recommend to a non smart tv or even a smart tv
1870	Mike	5	Must have if you have a Google Home	Received a Google Home Mini for Christmas and picked up Chromecast to remotely turn on TV or music in the living room for my daughter from the kitchen hands free. Works great, extremely convenient.
1871	Amber	5	Love Chrome Cast	I love my Chromecast, my whole family uses Chromecast for all of our casting needs
1872	Chromecast	5	Great Product	I love being able to stream netflix, youtube, etc.
1873	Gadgets	5	Chromecast & YouTube Tv	"Purchased Chromecast for, streaming to HD tv. Works very well.
Cut your cable bills. YouTube tv, for local, and many other cable tv channels. I’m sure as YouTube Tv grows so will the number of, streaming channels."
1874	ILikeBigMutts	5	Awesome	Love chromecast. We use it everyday. Easy set up and portable.
1875	Speedy	5	Easy to use	This product is simple to use. Once setup, find what you want to watch on a phone, table, or computer hit 1 button to watch on a tv and enjoy.
1876	Jon1	5	Great	Very easy to use and hasn't failed me yet! More than a year later and still working fine
1877	Kell	5	Great product	Very easy to set up to your tv and simple to use great for streaming movies
1878	Randy	5	Good Product	Purchased this during Black Friday sale. Streams from phone, tablet or computer seamlessly. Very happy with purchase.
1879	drey	1	Won't stay connected	I bought the Chromecast when it was first introduced. When it started having connectivity issues, I decided to purchase a new one - hoping that it newer equals more reliable. It's horrid. I have to shut down my entire wifi network and restart it for the Chromecast to find it and connect. Then I'll finally connect it to the app and get through a show. Next time I want to watch a show though, nothing shows up on my devices list. I have to go through the entire rigmarole again. Not worth the hassle.
1880	Snakes89	5	Great product low price	I have had zero issues and use this daily and for under $40 can't beat that, the picture and sound are excellent.
1881	TechMan	4	Love it	I take it whenever I travel. A great way to always have a smart TV with you.
1882	Dennis	4	Easy to cast to TV	Really enjoy using my Chromecast on my phone or tablet.
1883	Lokeshcivic	5	Excellent device	This chromecast is an excellent device to stream all the favorite content
1884	Lisa	3	Not sure what it does	I have only used chromcast to mirror my phone. Doesn't seem like it does much else.
1885	Darryle	1	Do not buy	This is one of the most worst products I have ever bought just getca firecstick
1886	Lilhippy88	5	Easy to use	Very easy to use. Makes putting media on the tv a brease, be it movie, music, videos whatever.
1887	benpkpk	5	work right away	i set it up within 5 mins It works right away with great video, and sound. I used it to watch youtube on my non-smart tv, love it.
1888	rhugh052	5	Great watching videos from my i pad	I like how this syncs with my i pad. I like to watch videos on the big screen. I like how it is easy to use, and set up.
1889	John9988	5	Love it!!	I love chromecast. It isn't expensive and does the job of apple tv.
1890	Benets	5	Impressed	Very easy to set up - took a few minutes and we were hooked up to Google Hone
1891	Lompi	5	This device is great and the way of watch TV	I have had Chromecast since it just was launched. It allows you to watch any youtube video in your TV and with today's internet speeds you can even watch live TV if you subscribe to Youtube TV, DirectTVnow or HBOnow. This will give you the freedom of not needing the Cable providers with those long term contracts. So it's a great option when having multiple TVs in the house so you do not need a cable box for each of them, you just need a Chromecast and get ready to Cast content.
1892	AimT	5	Useful	This is actually our 2nd one. The 1st one stays in the “man cave” but we bought this one to go with our new Google Home.
1893	Jaay	5	Everyone needs this	Chrome cast option so just come in All TVs but until then, good to have!
1894	Lisa	5	Chromecast	I have been tierd of cable tv for some time now. This Chromecast is exactly what I was looking for. I'm saving $140 a month now.
1895	Smiley	5	Awesome Chromcast	I love it, I literally use it everyday. I couldn’t imagine my ev without it.
1896	Bonnie514	5	Who wouldn’t like a chromecast	Perfect way to view everything on the tv. Easy to hookup, any problems.....Search YouTube for a video using your model of TV.
1897	Alll	4	Great	Great product easy to install I do recommend to other customers
1898	Anijo	5	Great product at great price	Got in black friday at great price. Works great, no issue so far
1899	adekunle12	5	Excellent	Been using it for some years now and it’s still working well
1900	BIBMazur	4	Good	Didn’t find much difference between this new chromecast and the old one. But it’s always a good gadget.
1901	Joeh	5	Great for cutting the cord	I love my Google Chrome cast. I had recently decided to stop paying the outrageous fees for satellite tv but needed ESPN for the New Year's Day bowl games. Chromecast and YouTube TV to the rescue!
1902	AC1750DualBand	5	better than previous	"my original chromecast would not work if it was not in front of the tv.
this one works even hanging in back."
1903	erika	5	Love it	I’m always watching Netflix on my tv. I even bought one for every tv I have.
1904	Music	5	Makes TV selections easier	Did not think I needed this but with the voice feature it makes watching Netflix effortless! Just ask and you receive! Very easy to use and setup.
1905	alitz	5	Great!!	I Was able to see my lectures on my TV BY CHROMECAST
1906	Monica	5	Good	It is really good. It came free so cant complain right.
1907	alexc97	5	Easy to use.	The Chromecast is super simple to install and hook up. And it makes it easy to share photos and other thing when friends are over and much more
1908	Laurie	5	Useful	This is my 3rd chromecast. I find it very usefull paired with Apple products. Plus price is very reasonable compared to Apple TV.
1909	Mike	5	Good one	"Great !!!
Got it for very good deal. Nice. Worth the price"
1910	bestbuyer	5	Great Smart Device	Absolutely love our Chromecast. Prefer it over our fire stick. Easy to use straight from your phone to your TV.
1911	Cass	5	Awesome for casting phone screen to TV	This product was everything I was hoping it would be and more. I can cast what is on my phone screen to have a mirror image on my flat screen. Which means I could watch YouTube videos, movies, or even show pictures from my phone straight to my tv so showing people is a lot easier. The best part is there is no cord it is completely wireless.
1912	AznEngr520	3	Bought this one because 1st one died 13 months	This Chromecast is much better and faster than the first gen Chromecast. Has dual band wireless 2.4/5 GHz chip. Does everything you expect from a Chromecast and does it well. The reason for 3 stars is that this is the second 2nd gen Chromecast I have bought because the first one just died 13 months into light use. 1-2 hours a month usage? So it was just burning energy most of the time behind my TV. That is why I was surprised that it died. I switched out power supplies to rule out the power brick and USB cable. So with my experience this 2nd gen Chromecast lasts about a year.
1913	Kris	5	Recommend	Product worked as advertised and was easy to set up. Best Buy purchase was fast & easy.
1914	Lucifer78232	5	Love it!	Quick, fast, and small. I enjoy being able to watch my programs and play games with this device.
1915	Loredo	5	Easy to install	Google Chromecast works great. Easy to use and easy to use.
1916	Bndonrun	5	Great streaming device	Works great. Easy set up. Now I can stream all my services and can skip the cable bill.
1917	Will	4	Great product	The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because you now have to pay in order to screen cast and for some reason the code won't appear on the bottom left corner like on my other chromecast not sure if the new ones don't have it or if I turned it off some how non the less still use it every day just have issues connecting.
1918	Krock	5	Worth it	I bought this for my 15 year old son. He has really had a blast with it. He can cash this phone to the TV, access our Amazon Prime for music and movies and Netflix. He's really loving it.
1919	KeithC	1	Horrible!	This item is supposed to be easy to use however it isn't. Everytime I try to cast I have issues the app doesn't work well and oftentimes the picture quality becomes quite distorted. Would never buy again.

1922	Cindy	5	Perfect way to cast music!	I bought a smart tv and didn’t realize that it didn’t come with a way to cast. I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased this. I do not regret it.

1950	GYBturbo	4	Okay streaming device	The device is okay... doesn't work great and seems to be a bit outdated... every new tv seems to handle what this device is offering. It is for the user that doesn't want to upgrade to a smart tv in my opinion. Also lags occasionally.

1957	RipzFax	5	Rocks	Google Chromecast is just an absolutely great gadget for streaming everything. Love the fact that I can cast my actual home screen on any tv through Google Home when using and Android device. This has helped me cut down my cable bill by allowing me to eliminate every cable box at home but one. Not fully ready to go all in on the CTC front but being able to cast any Channel who's app may not be Chromecast compatible yet but playable on my cable company's app is sweet.

1978	Manny	5	Great Product	Its a good product to have I purchased two and it works very well
1979	DarronD	5	Super Simple, Great With Google Home	I bought this because I needed a way to stream Netflix and Hulu without a PS4/Xbox/other expensive device. I chose the chromecast over the roku express because although the chromecast doesn’t have a remote, it requires some device to cast from. This means that whenever I use it, I’ll have my phone on me, and therein I’ll have a remote. I also very specifically chose the chromecast because the google home mini was on sale for 30 dollars, and this meant that even if I didn’t have my phone on me, I could just say “hey google out stranger things on tv” and it’ll do it. Same with play, pause, rewind, fast forward, etc. This feature does only work with Netflix and YouTube for now, but I think that will soon change. Standalone I think the chromecast is good, with a google home mini I believe the chromecast is amazing. I use them both numerous times a day, and with no notable hiccups along the way.

1999	BleepingIoT	5	Awesome home automation	I love just telling my google homes to play something on the tv. I hardly use my phone to cast but my wife enjoys the simplicity of doing so. I’m working on a large scale home automation project and I’m excited to integrate this with Nest IQ cameras so I can ask the GHs to display the camera feeds.

At this point I can't specify a certain episode (it just picks up playing where I left off) but I still like it."

2010	Vickie	4	Great product to get rid of cable	This produce was used with YouTube TV and Direct Tv now.

I YouTube Tv was $40 a month bit direct tv now I got a deal through my cell phone company and now I pay $35 a month and I get HBO and more channels for my kids through direct tv now.

2016	BrianStephens	4	Very Cool and Coming Along	I think this is a pretty cool product. I got it along with my Google home. I use the voce commands to control it and it seems to work pretty well. With Chromecast there's a good amount of movies and shows I can watch but I wish it has some free options. I like that i can watch shows, listen to music, play Netflix and there are lot's of great apps you can use with it. Compared to some others like Apple TV it has a little ways to go but over all for the price I really like it.

As we are happy with our TV and didn't wanna change it any time soon and also Youtube has become a part of our day-to-day life - so chromecast was the cheapest and best solution in our case and it didn't disappoint us. For us, chromecast is a youtube player and it works for it well.
2067	Rappy	5	Easy and straight forward to install. Works as adv	I hooked it up to my tv so that I could hear music from my Soundbar that I had attached to the the tv. Now, using my Google Mini, I can hear music using only a voice command.

2088	RPWIZ	5	Love it	Love chromecast! From casting movies from my Iphone, Ipad, Laptop or PC to my TV it really comes in handy to watch pretty much any media on any TV. Chromecast is easily powered by USB right on the TV and plugs into any HDMI on your TV.

2093	JACK	4	Device works ok for the cost	Easy hook up and sync with tablet or cell phone, but streaming video sometime slow and see pixel images.
2094	EdFullerton	4	Much improved but not as good as Amazon Fire Stick	I have the original one and this is much improved but in comparison the the Amazon Fire Stick, the Fire Stick is so much better and easier to use.
2095	Sabrina	5	good for streaming	i love using youtube on it and it is so easy and efficient to set up
2096	KevinE	4	Good gift for someone with the Google Home	Works pretty well with Google Home Mini. This device actually makes us consider getting a Google powered assistant to replace Alexa with :) It's pretty cool.
2097	Tetano	5	Life saver	Easy to use have had it for about a year use it every day and still works the same as it did last year.

2102	Crazycraig710	4	Works great with google home	I have a google mini and home and usually say what i want to watch before i sit down. If not, using your mobile phone makes it easier to navigate the plethora of movies and shows in streaming services

2104	Hemant	4	Tiny but versatile.	"This tiny one is really usefull even though you donot have a Smart TV. 
for mirroring and addititnal apps this is a real steal."
2105	SofaKingHumongus	2	STILL trying to justify...	"I bought the Google - Chromecast - Black during black friday for 20 bucks, thinking ""cool"" I could mirror my phone to the tv, so i can show my wife some photos and vids. It seems to to work some of the times.
I dont think its worth full retail price thou. If your looking for a smart tv dongle, I would advise buying a fire stick or ruku."
2106	Pidokenny	5	TV on-the-go	This device is great for on-the-go people. I have taken these to hotels and instead of paying for hotel movies, I just use this to play movies.
2107	Hopper	4	Great for streaming	Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play Music work great on the Chromecast. A separate remote would be a nice option.

2109	DebraB	4	Easy to use	This was an awesome product and it was super easy to use!
2110	gkulasik	5	Great streamer, Brilliant idea	"The Chromecast is such a great idea to bring the phone to the big screen. It is responsive, extensive, and simple. I love using this to watch movies and interact with guests.

I've had a couple of instances of the connection 'dropping' between the Chromecast and my phone, the content continues playing but I can no longer control it. This is very infrequent though, maybe three times in a few months."
2111	Srini	4	Great and fast	It’s easy to to handle and everyone likes it as it is very fast
2112	nassimo	2	Not working properly.	This device keeps turning on my toshiba tv by itself. And it stopped casting personal videos from my phone. So it does have issues with toshiba brand. I hope they find a solution soon.
2113	chandhu	5	good one while compare to other casting like roku	easy to use, no need of remote control, just one tap with our phone, tab or laptop.
2114	Jeff	5	So easy to use	I like the fact that it is so easy to install and use. Very good quality and I will definitely recommend it.
2115	JAZD	5	Very convenient	Chromecast is very convenient to use your phone or tablet to broadcast to the TV your Chromecast is plugged into making your TV a smart device. Great for sharing things from your phone or tablet with friends and family through your TV.
2116	travelinman123	4	It works	It works well to show things from your phone to your TV. Very easy to setup. Note, some new smart tvs have this capability built in.
2117	Manu	4	Good	Best buy ha the best collection and best price. Best value for money
2118	snapperheadjoe	4	It's a Chromecast do I really need to say more	This device has been around for years and has proven itself in the casting Arena as your go-to guy for sending stuff to your display easily, quickly and with beautiful picture quality. When Google added the assistant to the mix with all of its additional capabilities it made then device an even stronger contender in the smart casting category. I love the ease of use, the ability to cast from any device be it a PC, Android phone or iPhone. I don't believe there is an easier way to get your stuff from your device to your television than with the ubiquitous Chromecast. That said it does have its downsides there really are no built in apps and it doesn't support a direct remote control like the Amazon Fire devices or Roku Etc. So if you're looking for that sort of interface you will need to purchase one of the aforementioned devices the beauty of it is that most televisions have multiple HDMI ports so you can run many smart and casting devices to one television to get the best of many different worlds. Keep in mind if you have a 4K TV and want to stream 4K content you will need to move up to the Chromecast Ultra which costs more and provides the higher resolutions.
2119	Hamcs	4	New Model, New Easy Setup	"The new google cast not only have a very nice and compact design, but it is easy to setup.
You can stream from your smartphone, can be android or iphone, from your tablets, laptops or pcs/mac.
Great buy, great deal"
2120	kikenel	5	nice apps	I recommend this product, easy to install and it works very well with all the programs
2121	jbrow	5	So I hooked it up to my smart Johnny, why? Read!!!	"I just want to live in a world where google will turn on and turn off my Smart TV, This kinda brings us closer. hook up the chrome cast and turn on HDMI CEC (in tv menu) and tell google home to cast YouTube, Netflix, Pandora to your Samsung smart TV nicked named Johnny. thats really the only way to turn Johnny on instead of just saying "" Okay Google turn on Johnny"" no you say Okay google cast Netflix Teletubbies to Johnny and wallah, Johnny turns on and you can switch inputs and watch Hulu or Prime, for some reason you cant voice stream those to Johnny through chrome cast."
2122	PonchoHobono	5	So simple	It’s super easy to setup. When you plug it in, just follow the steps on the screen. It will be up and running in less than 5 minutes.
2123	BlingBlingLaMont	5	Does what it says it would	Turns my dumb LCD into a smart LCD. Running it through my Onkyo receiver and it works fine; no lag. Got it for $25.
2124	BasketballMom	1	Doesn't work with a hotspot	It way work just fine with wifi but with a cell phone hotspot it does NOT work. I sure wish a salesman would have told me this before I bought it.
2125	3230	5	Great price	So glad to be able to shop at Best Buy anywhere in the US. After being on vaction at Disney world and spending relaxingThanksgiving in Naples, Florida. All that was missing was Google Comcast. Shopping was a pleasure in this very well organized store.

2133	Kelvin	5	"Great way to make a ""dumb TV"" smart."	Works great, and 5 GHZ wifi band compatibility a big plus. This is a great way to smarten your tv.
2134	Kent	5	Chromecast is an awesome gadget.	I have been using Chromecast often at home and occasionally at work. For work, its convenient when we want to cast file such as a presentation with your phone. At home, my most frequent application is for casting YouTube.
2135	Strongmbs	2	Not on Fire!	"Having been a fire stick user for over two years and an Alexa owner for a year, I was always disappointed that Alexa couldn’t “talk” to the Fire. 

When learning Google Home could do just that with Chrome Cast, I couldn’t wait to rush out to Best Buy and purchase both (especially with the deals on Black Friday) 
I got home and thought I was going to have an early Christmas as I tore into the box. Then I couldn’t find the remote anywhere. So I did what every guy does (eventually) and read the directions. There is no remote, you must have a smart phone or other device you can watch content on and then use the Chrome Cast to “Cast” the content on your TV. 
I’m sure this is fine for most millenials and current teenagers who perform every daily task with aforementioned devices. However, Grandma and Grandpas would be lost. 
The original reason for the purchase though, pairing with Google Home, is a major positive! It works very well but content is still limited. Chrome cast is a long way behind Amazon Fire!"
2136	PG58	5	Purchased as a gift	Purchased to stream from laptop to my TV. Love it.
2137	MacGyver	4	Better than orginal model	I have used the original model of the chromecast for more than a year and this one runs smoother.

2145	Radio	5	Very good product.	Performance is very great. Useful to all members of the family.
2146	Arsenal	5	Easy to Use, Good picture	Set-up to the TV was easy. It took awhile for the device to update itself but was the hardest part of the set-up. Chromecast is easy to use. The power cord that connects the Chromecast to a power outlet is a bit short so I would recommend buying a longer cord if the outlet is not nearby.
2147	scottishsky	5	Awesome!	I had the first generation Chromecast, and bought this as an upgrade. Its been a wonderful addition to the family. Casting is so much fun!
2148	Eclipso	5	Awesome for home automation and fun for the family	Chrome cast works well. Love being able to control it with Google home mini. Casting YouTube to my television from phone is great too.

2151	bestb25	4	Good media streamer	Bought it to control my lg tv via voice with the google home but only got it to turn on the tv and not off, the problem probably is on the lg side. So check your cec hdmi on your tv if you want this to turn it on and off properly.

2175	Bhavik	4	Great product	Great product to stream things from mobile phone. I like the idea about casting things, but limited apps support this. Also I would have loved to have a remote and install apps like the way I can do on Firestick so that I don't have to open my phone every time I want to use it.
2176	Mark	4	Easy to use	plug in to tv and use phone or tablet as remote. Easy to set up and offers almost anything you can find for movie and tv show watching. Netflix,Sling,Hulu,YouTube, etc. Can’t get Amazon Prime though.
2177	LazyCook	4	Everything great except Amazon	I like how easy it is to setup and use this. One problem is Amazon Prime doesn't stream to it. Amazon and Google need to shake hands and get this done.
2178	Wally	5	As gift	Got it as a gift for my dad and it's streaming not that bad
2179	CWit	5	Great way to stream	"Like being able to stream from my iPad shows I am have accessed to 
a TV for better viewing"
2180	OCfamily	2	Worst Product of its Kind	Chromecast isnt as good as Fire Stick for streaming content, especially if you use Apple products, who do not integrate well with Google Android or Amazon Prime streaming content. You will have to download numeorus apps to stream and will not have access to half the content. Worst streaming purchase Ive made.

2200	DrRedstone	5	Streaming? Buy this!	"It's a chromecast. That means it has near universal support. It might take some time getting used to, but it is worth the effort. I can stream pretty much anything I want with ease.. Just casting my desktop allows me to bypass the nasty feud Amazon and Google have at the moment, so no worries about getting Amazon Prime video to play. 

Standard support for Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, Youtube, and a variety of other streaming sources.

This is my go to for wedding gifts as it is so incredibly versatile and the price point is great. I've purchased somewhere between 10-15 in the past several years."

2230	Guddu	5	Chromecast is excellent device for streaming	"Using Chromecast for streaming SlingTV, Youtube, Netflix and others web videos. Nice feature compared to Apple TV is once it starts streaming through Chromecast you can be free from your device, while on apple TV I noticed if I closed the app on my phone it stops streaming.
You can stream from a chrome browser webpage if you install the cast extension."
2231	ldfarris	5	Cast your devices to your tv screen	This product does what it claims. I use it to cast Netflix from my phone to my tv that does not have the Netflix app. I also enjoy using it to share photos I've taken on my phone with family and friends by projecting them onto my tv screen.

Just plug it into an available hdmi slot on the tv, plug the usb power into an outlet, let the chromecast update to the latest firmware, and you're done and ready to watch the latest android app content. Simply easy and amazing to use.

2258	TimW	4	Easy and low cost replacement	I've been experiencing slow downloads with iTunes movies through Apple TV. It would take 10-15 minutes of buffering for a movie to play, and then there would be slow downs during play. I considered purchasing the new Apple TV with additional memory, but wondered if it was necessary to spend $200+ to stream movies. I purchased this item, and have been amazed with the speed of downloads from Google Play and Netflix. No more waiting and wondering if the movie or show is going to play. The Chromecast is fast, easy to set-up, and good value compared to Apple TV. I use my Chromebook to run the Chromecast App, but the app also works from Apple OS or Android.

2297	TheMinnesotian	5	Great device for casting	I analyzed multiple devices for casting programming to a TV and settled on the Chromecast.

2299	dongoard	3	Isn't working for me.	"I haven't got it working. It's likely not the product. Still, it's frustrating to have it and not be able to use it. Recommend to a friend? I would say, ""I don't know."" But, since you make me answer ""yes"" or ""no"", I said ""no""."

2325	roxie86	4	Easy set up	Once u download the app the rest is pretty easy to set up and start watching movies.

2344	WayneLIC	5	Great for casting video from laptop to TV	I still use my Roku for apps to watch Netflix, Hulu, etc. but Google chromecast is great for casting shows from your laptop to your TV. Works seamlessly and have never had a problem.

2353	Jladwig	5	Great for pick projector	Works great for pico projector to cast from cell phone.
2354	derekw2001	4	Works as intended	It works as intended. Still not sure about leaving something just dangle from any sort of port. The weight would eventually ruin the port but hopefully not in the lifetime of the device and/or tv.
2355	Amanda	5	Great Purchase	Works great! Happy with my purchase! Will be buying more for our other TV’s
2356	Beatsshd	4	Easy to Set up	Product is easy to set up and great to make any regular HD tv into a smart TV

2359	Superwildcard	5	Easy to use and works great	Casting has become my obsession. Whenever I want to view something on the big screen it is just a simple button away. I have 4-5 chromecast enabled devices at home and can easily add whatever content I want from my favorite sources seamlessly.

2362	ShReay	5	Works seemlesly	I have an android phone and this thing did wonders for my TV and paired with the home mini works pretty good
2363	ar1234	5	well worth the price	Google helps simplify your day-to-day life online, and the Google Chromecast is no exception as the software giant can now also take over your TV. The Chromecast is an HDMI streaming stick, and is perfect for anyone looking for an easy way to stream pictures or videos wirelessly to their TV.
2364	Pito912	4	Works great!	Works really well, and really nice to have handy in one's home.
2365	Sachin	5	Great casting experience	Great casting experience from Mac, Android & iOS devices.
2366	dkar300	3	Was hoping for more	The idea of casting images from my cell phone to a television is a good one. But you're limited by what the app on the cell phone can do. Can't cast the thing i bought it for so i am disappointed.
2367	Bruce	5	Works perfectly, runs cooler than the older model.	I have had the older model Chromecast for 4-5 years, and really enjoyed it. The big problem is that it always ran hot, like burn your fingers hot, which always worried me. This one gets warm, but not nearly as hot as the old one. I use it to turn my bedroom TV (older, no wireless card) into a semi-smart set. Works great, worth it.
2368	Cris	4	Good product but	It only mirror content on my phone. Would be nice an stand alone feature like Amazon
2369	Energy	5	Great purchase	Ease of use and excellent add-on to Smart TV also where you do not have to struggle with remote while searching on you tube or connecting HDMI cables when playing movies on laptop. Definitely good purchase.

2374	JUICYCUPID	4	Must have streaming device	Love my Chromecast! Has a lot more compatibility when compared with Apple or Amazon Fire Stick. Just wish that it had the option to mirror (w/ sound) the browser on your phone or tablet.
2375	Sean	5	A must have.	This is an amazing tool for streaming from a device to your TV. We have four in our house. One for each TV. Each is named for the room it is in. When the TV is on, we can see it in the list and choose. When moving room to room you can easy switch on the app. Love this device.
2376	Kidtoni	4	Good addition with Google Home	I had the first gen chromecast and if worked good. Few connection problems but still good. This new one is fantastic. Responsive and works great with google home mini that I got here. Could even turn on my tv with my voice. Great buy. I think I spent 25 for it on cyber Monday. Can’t go wrong with it.
2377	Jayaditya	4	good price	Got this during the holidays deals, but have not used yet. Will be using this with the TV which doesn't have other players.
2378	Marc	5	Best Streaming device	If you have a non-4k tv. This is the best streaming device for you especially if you want youtube.
2379	Rmagallon000	5	It works.	It works but I wish it had some basic apps on it like YouTube tv or play movies
2380	bob990	5	Still the best for streaming...	I purchased this Chromecast to replace one of the original first generation Chromecasts that one of the kids had destroyed. Chromecast is still the easiest way to stream media, and integration with the new Google Home and other voice controlled home products means streaming has never been easier. 5 Stars all the way at our house.
2381	SusanT	5	Love it	Streaming movies and tv shows from my iPad is more enjoyable on the big screen. This product is so easy to install and even easier to use.
2382	devish123	4	Good for price	"Marginally faster streaming
Nifty, versatile new design
Same low price"
2383	SamMcChucky	5	Great companion to Google Home	Connect this to your TV and command your Google Home to play Netflix or YouTube without touching your remote!
2384	Eddie	4	Great for the bedroom.	This is great for my bedroom. I can cast Netfilx from my laptop or phone. The only issue is that it sometimes doesn't sync with the soundbar. It will also turn off the signal so you have to unplug it and plug it back in to cast anything, kinda annoying.Overall I like it and it really does a great job.
2385	BorderGuy	3	Not a smooth stream	Doesn't accept casts from a Samsung 5 very well. Haven't seen how well it does with a laptop.
2386	Yeboi445	5	Great product	PERFECT PRODUCT goes very well with my google Home mini and is good to watch YouTube and Netflix
2387	sibenj	4	Definitely an improvement over first-gen	Got this to replace my first generation Chromecast. The 5GHz WiFi option is definitely an advantage if you have a router that supports that
2388	SCP323	4	Faster than before	I currently own an older model chromecast and it worked great but this newer model seems faster and it performs better...
2389	Showtime	5	Nice product	Google cast is great to cast your phone and laptop without having to hook up hdmi wires to stuff like the laptop.
2390	Chris	5	Nice device	Neat little device to access some cool online content
2391	Army	4	I use this in my car	I bought this to cast my phone on the screen in my car and it works well. I wish I could use the touch screen in the car instead of still having to use the phone screen, but I think that's an issue with my car.
2392	MarkR	4	Easy streaming.	This works great to stream YouTube, Google movies, mirror your phones. And especially awesome if you have a Google mini to pair it with.
2393	Chrls	5	Superior to Streaming Sticks & Boxes	This little guy kicks the !@#$% out of my Fire and Roku for no lag, no buffering streaming. Running a 200mbs mediacom line, I shouldn't get any lag at all, but this device is maximises the stream and keeps it moving flawlessly. Could always use more cast friendly apps, but the performance is superb.
2394	MelG	5	So convenient	Project anything on your phone to your tv. Great for watching YouTube videos or viewing photos. Can also be used to wirelessly project your computer screen to the tv. One of my favorite gadgets
2395	Billie	5	I really enjoy my chromecast i purchased from best	Best buy has top of the line inventory and i really enjoy the chromecast I purchased at their store in Shreveport
2396	EzE2011	5	Awesome campaign to Google Home	This and my google home speaker are great companion devices to have. You can control your tv using the google home and even play your music, any video and if streams Netflix very well.
2397	tvforme	5	love it	it'sa definite upgrade from the original chromecast-
2398	Freaky	3	Good selection for new streamers	I connected quickly and easily and began to enjoy watching my selections on a larger screen.
2399	Pete	5	Works great!	This item works great and makes it easy to stream shows!
2400	Iscak	5	Great google product	U got a good deal from Best Buy. Google chrome cast is a great everyday use product recommended to everyone with a smart tv. Works seemlessly and easy to use
2401	LuVelde	3	Simple but effective	This device is very simple, but it does work as advertised. It has issues when you pause/resume content -- I tried streaming from multiple platforms & experienced the same issue. Another annoyance... it plays the first 10-15 seconds of content in very low quality. I would personally prefer that it buffer longer, then play full quality content.
2402	Chatterwalker	4	Useful Gadget	I've only used this modestly at this point but it seems to work okay. I live in a rural (country) location in the woods so my biggest issue is finding a reliable internet service provider that provides broadband that's fast enough to use it without unreasonable data cap thresholds (e.g., 5GB) before being throttled down to an unusable speed (2G). Overall, product seems good. Hopefully, I'll be able to make better use of it at some point.
2403	Mata	4	Worth every penny	Perfect item for trying to get rid of cable. World great.
2404	Jeremy5756	5	Nice addition to our smarthome	We recently moved into an older home that had no ceiling lights. We soon found that it was a task turning off three different lights at a time. SO, we went to Bestbuy and purchased a Google Home mini along with the Philips Starter pack w/A19 bulbs and let technology do the work for us. We decided to go all the way and purchase a Chromecast and have Google turn on, pause, play, our TV. Now we ask Google to turn off the lights our TV, up the volume and Boom, its done. We love our smarthome now.
2405	Bashaw	4	Solid Performer	I use this to take with me when on travel to manipulate the TV via my phone. Works well.
2406	LovelyEddie	5	I love it	It’s great for TVs that don’t come with Netflix or Hulu
2407	Ankurjgeorgia	3	Good for streaming your phone	Chromecast is a bridge between your phone and TV. You want to.stream some phone app on TV, you use Chromecast. In this case the app actually uses.your phone's resources while streaming. I prefer fire stick by Amazon over this. Because it is an actual android TV kind of device with its own in-built memory. Hence, it does not use your phone's resources. Also firestick is stabler than Chromecast.
2408	Harewood1214	5	Great use for bedroom or living room.	This device is amazing. I use it with my google home mini and it couldnt be any better
2409	Julian	5	One of the best in its class. Google has rich data	One of the best in its class. Google has rich databases and thus has lots of potentials. The knowledge in its database can be integrated into the system to become one of the most powerful voice-activated search engine. Too bad, we have to rely too much on this machine and we will lose our privacy. Google has already know how we write (via its gmail), and soon google has our voice-print. Convenient vs privacy... which one do you choose?
2410	Jink	5	Great broadcasting	I have one 1st gen google chrome cast. My tv is old so it does not have USB power. For this new one with long USB line and included converter, much flexible to use. Great improvement.
2411	Debbie	5	Great gift	I purchased these items as gifts for Christmas (for my sons)
2412	AYut	5	Great for the cost	Got this to go on another TV, since I have Apple TV hooked up to another. I do think that the Apple TV is better, but you cannot beat the Chromecast for it's price.
2413	Lyte	5	Chromecast	It was a gift and it worked out perfect for my grandson.
2414	Manohar	3	Great price	Great price for product and it is very small and can be fixed
2415	Supergrl89	5	Great product	I got tired of watching YouTube videos on my phone and decided to purchase Chromecast. Can you say Game changer. The instructions to set up are super easy to follow. Great buy overall.
2416	Luis	5	Cool device	This is a nice device to have on the TV to be able to make it smart and connect your phone.
2417	eaterofhotpockets	5	Love it	It's exactly what I expected. Works great with all electronic devices I own.
2418	Chriscrv	5	Great device to use for TV	I love this chrome cast, best device to set everything from my cell phone to my TV
2419	bushky	5	Set up was a breeze	"This is my 3rd Chromecast, and they keep getting better.

Set up was super easy, and I don't know how, but the three don't get confused which monitor I want."
2420	BestBuy101	4	Amazing!	Would recommend this to anyone looking to stream from their phone to television.
2421	Audioengineer	1	So Far, Nothing.	I can’t get the Chromecast to work. It keeps getting stuck trying to update itself. I’ve followed all of the instructions from Google but alas, no luck. I’ve pretty much given up. What a waste of money. Really disappointed.
2422	NOTE5	5	Perfect	Easy to install and use. Great video playback. Should have purchased sooner
2423	SieSie	5	TV streaming	This device is perfect for parties with the millions of videos & songs available. Netflix app is a must!
2424	TheHistorian	5	Good product	It’s good, but not supporting amazon prime video is annoying.
2425	netWARIOR	5	Fills the need	"I have a ""smart"" TV that plays video files from an HDD, but sometimes it just won't play a video format. I bought this so that I could stream stuff from my computer or phone that the TV won't innately play. Does just that. A+ product, Google."
2426	GreenStang	5	Must have for any home	Great simple product that every home that likes streaming video must have. Works much better than having smart TV capabilities. It's a good addition even to smart TVs
2427	Venkat	5	Good	It's a good product and easy to use. Makes life better and a single click is good to cast the videos.
2428	Sreekanth	2	Not good	Frequently disconnecting from network while streaming through this device
2429	Khush	5	Great for casting	Good product to cast anything from phone or laptop.
2430	Queensson	5	Great	No problems at all. I bought a few of them for the house.
2431	Darren	4	Easy setup	Works fine for basic video casting. No skipping noticed. Easy and quick setup. Not all apps allow casting.
2432	robbmen12	5	Love it	That's a perfect gift for this Christmas, very reliable
2433	Santosh	5	Great cast device for the price	Works great with my Google Home mini and easy integration with my phones! Highly recommended for a smart home.
2434	DaddyLC	4	Works great	Once setup it works wonderfully. Little glitchy from time to time however worth it. Do your research before setting up YouTube TV. Tucson has all sporting channels blocked out.
2435	Nana	5	Like it for TV	I love seeing what I have on my phone on my TV and everyone could use it .
2436	Huumai	5	Good product	Just Plug and play. Plug in to TV follow the instruction on the tv screen. It is easy to setup.
2437	Eilian	4	An upgrade	We had an old version Chromecast and decided to get this one to replace. Installation was pretty straight forward.The new version does feel faster than the 1st gen. No complain
2438	Wendy	5	Great	Got this as a gift for my son he likes to stream TV instead of use cable
2439	Alba	5	Great cromecast and you can use it with your smart	I like it very much and it is very easy to use and enjoy
2440	michaelos	5	These are just fantastic	I have a Chromecast now on every TV in my house. It makes playing anything from any android device super simple!! I have movies in Google Play... just cast to the big screen!!
2441	Flynt	5	I have 2’of of these and plan to buy 3-4 more	"These are so very very good when you learn to use them with your google Assistant devices. Don’t have an Assistant, you can use your phone or your computer then. Very versitle and very reliable. 

When mine are showing me the content from google speaker or streaming something for me to see I leave the Monitors running to display slide shows from my personal photos. It’s will als display all Types of news, sports, recipes, professional beautiful photos and so much more. 

See my other review to see how I use them with my Google speaker. 


Pair one of these up to a google speaker and you have a tool that is much better than that Alexa video device."

2448	Saravana	4	Overall good	This product is good if you are looking for a low budget streaming device
2449	John	5	Does exactly what it's supposed to do!	Setting up the Chromecast was super easy! Nothing to install on the phone or laptop and works like a dream! Wish there were a few more apps and websites that are compatible, but it's already a pretty sizable list so I am super happy with the purchase (especially during Black Friday!)
2450	Mrstuart0	5	Perfect	It does everything that it's supposed to do. It does great with other Google devices.
2451	dannyjpm	5	Excelent product	I bought this product following the recommendations of a friend and it result very helpful when entertainment is required.

2455	cameron	5	cord cutting solution!	"we stopped cable 2 years ago and was plugging in our laptop via hdmi cord for netflix, you tube, cbs app...For the price chromecast is the best solution. It basically gives my tv internet capabilities. You can ""cast"" anything from your phone or computer to your tv without wires. Plug in the cromecast into the hdmi imput and plug in to a power source and your ready to go"
2456	Mic214	4	Just what i needed	It is useful to me and my family... sometimes it is slow, but just what we need
2457	zooy	5	Wonderful	If you are into WiFi casting, this would be a great device for your home theatre package... however, I have purchased mine to use it in the car, so I can cast movies to the kids while on the road...
2458	Vizagoth	5	Great alternative	Not being able to buy a new smart tv I decided this would be the next best thing. I have quite a few movies and TV programs through Google and it is nice to view them on a larger screen than my tablets 10.1 in. Great for those who don't have the means but still can watch online programs.
2459	Vivian	5	Great device for watching movies	I brought more than 20 chrome cast for myself and my friends, we all happy with it.
2460	scorch01	5	Great for easy streaming	The google mini and the chromecast work great with each other. The product is easy to use and setup.
2461	5150willy	5	Buy it	Awesome device, I'm a big fan, because all of the control is in your phone, you don't need to worry about login in both on phone and device, very convenient
2462	Evadanjen	4	Worth the price	Picked this up during Black Friday sales. Came in very handy during incremental weather. Satellite tv went out during snow. Internet connection stayed working and this cromecast came in handy
2463	Kisash	4	Works good.	This works, but it requires to be connected to the internet before it can be used.
2464	Achamp	5	Convenient	Like the convenience and ease of use with my phone. Very handy, we really enjoy it!
2465	yangwawa	5	Wish I had gotten it earlier	Bought it during Best Buy's Black Friday sale and have been using it daily. It's making watching Youtube on TV so much easier!

2467	Griffin	4	Great device	We love my Chromecast. It is easy to setup and use even with no technology knowledge.

2469	laxshorty182	5	For Work	It works great for everything we need it for at work.
2470	Trpeople	4	Good product to stream media to TV	Even though this only casts in 1080p resolution, I find it very easy and useful. Bought this one for my sister to connect her new Google Home Mini to her tv.
2471	Vinnie	4	Great for streaming from your phone	I really was skeptical about buying it but once I used it, I found it to be very helpful for streaming things from my phone
2472	flakes	5	nice device	i got this during thanksgiving, it was a great deal!!!
2473	Vini81	5	best chromecast	if you need a device to streaming from your phone or tablet this is the best way to go
2474	Vallu	4	Love this streaming device!	It’s great that you can use your phone as a remote- i previously had a fire stick and constantly lost the remote!!
2475	Saketh	5	Worthy	Worth buying.Great quality. Definitely recommending to others.
2476	Wizkid	5	Great product	Easy to carry and just hook up to any tv or projector and watch
2477	Kittu	1	It’s not working	Not working at all.its showing update required but not all updating
2478	Karim	5	Great product	Awesome product I can cast everything I need straight to my tv
2479	HWCHO	4	Better than Roku	I think Google Chrome is more versatile because many apps are free on Google Play. I also own a Roku stick and the options are far more limited if you are not willing to pay for subscriptions. I like Google Chrome because I can cast YouTube to my TV. Although Roku can do the same, it doesn't allow me to type Chinese characters to search for Chinese videos; whereas, I can type in Chinese characters using my phone to search on YouTube and cast the video to be viewed on my TV.
2480	bestbuyboy	4	Can't get it to cast with 2 devices	I owned this product previously and was satisfied. I had to rebuy it when I changed devices. Before I paid $35, this time I'm glad I waited, as I paid only $19.99!!! Never have I seen it at a discount, let alone a savings of about $15. Works good with my phone, but can't get it to cast from my laptop. Does it work with both? I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!
2481	gr8ramses	5	Love it	"Works great. We attached it to our Samsung 85"" TV in our training room at work. The team loves it."
2482	Chadcoe20	5	Great improvements over 1st Generation	Chrome Cast 2nd generation works better than the 1st. It is much faster and holds a longer connection.
2483	RM2016	5	Big improvement	I had the old version for years and found that it wasn't as staple as it should be, this new version is great, smooth streaming and casting without any issue.
2484	photog1	5	Works well	I got this for my new smart TV because it allows me to turn the tv on with my Google Home Mini. It is good for casting to the tv also.
2485	Loftburn	5	Great to have for tv	The chrome cast is a great attachment for your tv, I like the features it has and how it works with google home.
2486	Chris	5	So convenient!	Perfect for Netflix and Hulu. Also great for casting music via Google Play or Spotify. Control via your phone or Google Home.
2487	BiGTV	4	cool gadget	I really like this device, i can stream from my phone to the TV with ease
2488	TrekRules	4	Solid device	I'm a Star Trek nut and bought this for the sole purpose of watching Star Trek: Discovery on CBS All Access, which it does well. But there's so much more it can do. The video and sound quality are top-notch. It can get a little skippy if the router signal is less than perfect.
2489	dkintn	4	nice addition to google home	needed this to make the package complete.Will add many hours of great viewing choices.
2490	Daddy	5	Simplifies your apps...	This chrome cast device had made my life easier. Prior to having this, I had to hook my phone up to the receiver to play my music. Problem solved!!!
2491	Raven	1	Cannot connect	Don't bother buying if you plan on connecting to a Nighthawk Netgear router. it would not connect and I sat on the phone for an hour with customer service with no luck.
2492	Rlucas23	4	Easy set up and great payoff	Brought 2, the one close to the router was smooth. The one away from the router will not work unless I hook it up to tv closer to the router. A
2493	pfg1118	5	Great product	Dependable and well made; I have an additional from casting my house and they always work well and it has not given me trouble in the last 2 years of use.
2494	Avac12	5	New and Improved	Had the old chromecast and loved it. However, the stick version didn't last. This one seems more sturdy and works great! Glad they changed the look of it!
2495	daboyzz23	5	Great	I had the original Chromecast which worked great. Needed to buy another one for a different room, and this one works just as great maybe even better.
2496	blue23fdhg	5	Great product	I am always a chrome user.. very easy to use and connect to TVs, great gift for Christmas
2497	Buckler	5	Outstanding Product, Easy Setup	This product is very easy to set up and works like a charm. Highly recommended product!

2505	Angela	4	Great product	I love the fact that I was able to turn my TV into a Smart TV and cast my apps to it. The price at Best Buy was the best.
2506	Ivyp	5	Exactly what I was looking for	I was choosing between Roku and Google. What I need is to watch Youtube videos or other apps on TV. The employee at Best buy was very helpful. I bought this one and I really love it. It is super easy to install and use. The best thing is if I watch Youtube videos on TV, there is no commercials to interrupt. Great value.
2507	Sandy	5	Excellent product	I bought Chromecast last year and it is working great
2508	HALLEY	5	great product	very easy to set up, and can works with my TV and computer monitor without any issues
2509	Gator	5	Great for tv	Bought this for my living room and everyone loves how convenient it is
2510	Priyesh	4	Four star	Not bad for the Black Friday price, very fast to play you phone video on TV
2511	Kushi	4	Makes life easy	I have connected my chromecast with google home, so i just enter home and ask google to play
2512	Sijan	4	Good but not 5 star worthy	The connection gets frozen time to time and I have to reset the chrome cast
2513	VLORDZ	4	Great product, easy to set-up.	Got this when my satilite dish went out. It was easy to set up right of the box. Easy to use.
2514	Martha	5	Inexpensive and Easy to use	You get your bang for the buck with the chrome cast. Setup is really easy. I mainly use it for Netflix, which works well but sometimes disconnects.
2515	lkt1	4	Good for movies	Easy to setup and easy to use. Great for watching movies on Tablet.
2516	Mick	4	It's ok	This product does exactly as promised by Google. Chromecast is nothing fabulous though. I like the Roku much better. Much more versatile in my mind.
2517	GaGamingFun	4	Nice addition to Google Mini	Bought the Chromecast first and found it was convenient to use with Google Assistant on my phone. Bought a Home Mini to take my phone out of the loop. 4 stars because it would be better with a remote and more internal apps.
2518	Danny	3	very helpful product but not very reliable	I like this Chromecast because with it I can access many TV shows or programs any time I want, and free of charge. very convenient. The problem is it is not very reliable. It sometimes disconnects itself without reason. Lately I need to reconnect it almost everyday. Very annoying.
2519	DivaGadgits	5	Love it	I love this I travel with this and hook it up to my portable projector and my phone or tablet becomes a a night at the movies. Best purchase ever. Thxs Best Buy
2520	Felicia	5	It's part of a gift I put together.	I can't say much because it hasn't been used, yet.
2521	OU1MOM	5	Great item for students at college	I bought 2 as Christmas gifts for my children in college- they use all of the time.
2522	Truebogusbird	5	Excellent product	Absolutely love it. Works great with no lag. I searched everywhere to find if it needs WiFi, but found out on my own it surely does.
2523	JEJE	5	Happy!	We have chrome cast for every TVs. So happy with purchase!
2524	hendu664	5	Great Product	Wanted to add to Google Home and this is what was needed. Easy to send YouTube Music and other media to television.
2525	AnInternetCitizen	4	I LOVE my Chromecasts	"For me, this is easily the best way to get web content on my TV. A wide variety of apps using an interface you're already familiar with, and you don't have to go through using the up, left ,left, left, *oops* right process to type in usernames and passwords. 

The only con is there isn't some kind of separate remote for when you want to quickly pause. Some apps implement a lock screen control to play/pause, but if they haven't, you're digging through the app to pause it. Problematic if the reason you're trying to pause is an incoming phone call. Otherwise, solid option."
2526	Rick	5	Love it	Excellent price and quality. No issues at all, this Crome cast is just what we needed
2527	Losmasones	5	Great for android	I have use this item in all my tvs, works very well
2528	Niki	5	LOVE IT!!!!	Amazing product, It was super easy to set up and in no time I had excellent quality in my TV. You can broadcast anything from a device that has google chrome (from what I have tried). Completely recommended!
2529	ChiChi	2	Not Great	Doesn’t work well for live streaming like I was told it would be.
2530	Shawn	5	GREAT!	Pretty Cool device allows you to watch whatever from your mobile on to your tv!
2531	sammy	5	easy set up	I've had this for about 6 months now. Set up was very easy and so is casting. Great watching shows on the big screen. Should have bought this sooner. Definitely worth purchasing.
2532	Desorden	5	Love it	It was easy to install and setup, you can stream easy.
2533	random138	4	Works great, needs more apps	"I use my chromecast primarily for streaming music. I have my TV connected to my receiver and am able to listen to music through my stereo. I used to use a Bluetooth receiver connected to my stereo but the connection was not great and would suffer from pausing and ""skipping"" due to buffering which made listening difficult. The chromecast eliminates these issues as the music sounds crisp and clear. I am also able to move from room to room without affecting playback at all. I have not had any issues with streaming movies through the device either. My only complaint is that I wish there was more apps available comparable to other major brands streaming devices."
2534	Toya86	5	Great for streaming	Great for someone who doesnt have a computer. You can mirror everything right from the phone
2535	Khushnur	5	Just awesome!	Bought this chromecast as I like to stream movies and music a lot on my TV. Barely use my remote anymore. And also, when i’m not using it, the screen on my TV doesn’t just stay still, but instead it shows me high quality images to keep me entertained!
2536	MrsA	5	Great device	Stream smoothly and is very affordable. Easy to set up.
2537	Vicky	4	Certainly easy to use, but does give keep crashing	Compared to other casting devices, Chrome cast is surely easier to use. With the ability to cast anything on the internet through chrome browser, makes it a good option. However, it has been crashing a lot these days, i read a lot of blogs on the support site as well reporting the same. Other than that it is pretty good
2538	Jimmiemac	4	I enjoyed it so much I purchased another	I really like the chrome cast it works just like I intended it to do. it is very easy to use.
2539	Chuck	5	It's a chromecast.	It's a chromecast. It does its job without complaining, maybe you should too.
2540	Alanf	5	Good	I have used the Amazon firestick, as well another miracast device. This just works for what I need it to do. I don't get pauses or jitters in the stream. I would recommend this to anyone that thinks they may be able to use it
2541	PBKD	5	Very Good	Google - Chromecast - Black is working very well! I love it
2542	Antonio	5	Great for anyone who wants to make their tv smart	This chromecast is a great way to make any tv smart and it has worked great for me.
2543	MisterD	4	Love the simplicity.	This device gave me seamless viewing of content. I would purchase more if needed.
2544	cwill	5	Great little device	The ability to stream my phone to my TV and control things like Netflix and Hulu is great. Never have to worry about looking for the remote :)
2545	Kenia	4	It was for a gift	It was a gift for someone else hope they like it and it works
2546	08May	1	Compatibility issues	While buying I thought I could use Google Chrome to operate this. But this device is not supported by the chrome browser of any Apple or amazon device. To use this product which is $20 I won’t buy a $200 device.

2552	mrplow	5	It works really well	Works how I want it to and makes life convenient for watching YouTube on the television.
2553	Heavyweight	5	My second one	It works great for my kids, it’s my second one this year

2566	Theramin	5	Performs as advertised.	Plugged it in. Installed it. No problem. It performs as advertised.

2569	Partyof7	5	good product	Wasn't too sure about how this would work out, but I'm shocked that it is compatible with all of my devices. we use it to cast and streamed. also works great with the Google Home.

2582	parker	3	Not as good as older model	it works ok. But I would say it's worse than the previous model. Sometimes, it couldn't be searched by my devices.

2584	TBiGZ	5	Google chromecast + G Home mini = winning combo!!!	Using the Google chromecast with the Google home mini provides a very convenient way of watching your youtube videos online.

2590	Jdc1	4	Great Addition to Living Room TV	"Purchased this as a Black Friday bargain. It’s a great asset for those moments when you have visitors over and would like to show a video over the big screen quickly.

I also stream DirectTV Now with the Chromecast, and it works flawlessly.

I haven’t ran into an app that it couldn’t handle.

Being an iPhone owner, I do prefer the Apple TV, but the cost of the chromecast is too good to pass up."

2595	Djhawaii	5	Must Have	If you watch movies, listen to music, have Netflix, take pictures....you have to have one. Best purchase I ever made.
2596	WockFlockaFlameBrickSquad	5	Easy way to stream stuff to your TV	There are newer Chromecasts, but they're all the same except for resolution. Plug and play simplicity for streaming YouTube, Netflex, or other media content to any TV with a USB port. It is easy and a must have to make any dumb TV smart
2597	Chris	4	Very good.	Really good Android comparability. Only thing I don't like is it doesn't have digital audio out.
2598	Chimmie	4	So so for using YouTube tv live	It’s ok and works well for youtube tv live.. but sucks I would need additional ones for each tv in my house
2599	JCDzul	5	Easy setup	Very easy to install and to pair with google home, you will love it
2600	USBDriveUser	5	Easy to Use! Plug it in, Enter the code. Cast.	Got this on sale and use at work for the smart board screen. Awesome.
2601	Dmk523	3	Disappointing	Am limited as to what i can cast to my television. Can't get the sports i want.
2602	eringg	4	Good product, but not for me.	Chromecast is a good product it works, easy to set up but I use Amazon prime and if you want to use it for that service forget it. Google and Amazon don't work together at all had to return it and get another product.
2603	Bugs	5	Nice product	I love that it connects to my google home and can pull up whatever I ask it to.
2604	Maggz	5	Really like for the price!	Purchased it when it was on sale, and I loved it. Great when I watch YouTube, Netflix, listen to Pandora & love that I can easily connect with my smartphone. Also love that I can mirror my screen without a hassle. I only had to reset it once since I purchased it in 2015, but it was fast and quick. Great product.
2605	Frank	5	Works great	I love it this workd great andit is very easy to use.
2606	MissesR	5	Easy install more apps	I live chromecast. I’ve been a chromecast person since the first one came out. They have more apps now. Love it!

2608	Mari	5	Happy	Bought for my nephew for Christmas works nice great gift for teens
2609	Cp53	5	Good system	Works frwat, no problems. I listen to mainly music
2610	indy	5	What a great piece of tec	Love the easy way to get onto Netflix and Pandora. My nephew told me to go down to Best Buy and pick this up
2611	Mike	5	Works well	Easy to use and easy to set up. Its a nice way to stream our favorite shows
2612	Himanshuv20	4	Worth every penny	"I wanted a really easy way to stream content from my phone to my TV (MotoGP video pass and YouTube videos specifically). The Chromecast makes it very easy. I plugged the unit into the HDMI input on my TV and plugged its USB tail into the USB input on my TV. (The device is pretty light, but I used a zip tie through opening on my TV to help support it just so I didn't put any stress on the HDMI or USB ports. I'm withholding one star because the USB tail is so short. It only just reached my USB port; any farther and I would have had to get a USB extension cable.) The device walks you through set up and it's very easy, just a few steps. Download the Chromecast app from the Play store, enter a code, connect to your Wifi network, choose a security setting and you're up and running. When I open the YouTube app on my phone, a little icon appears in the player to ""cast"" it to the TV, and it just a few seconds the video plays on my TV instead of my phone. Sometimes it takes a few moments to get the full HD version of a video streaming but usually it's pretty quick. The Chromecast app has some additional Chromecast-compatible apps that you can use. I haven't explored them, since I really just wanted to do two things. Streaming MotoGP video pass: (Skip this section if you're not interested in this.) The MotoGP app on Android doesn't support Chromecast natively; however, there is a simple workaround. Just go to the MotoGP site in the Chrome browser and login to your MotoGP account. Select a video and tap to play. A ""cast"" icon will appear on the video player container. Tap the cast icon and the video will be sent to the Chromecast unit and will play on your TV. Hooray! I find that live video streams are little more difficult to get an uninterrupted 1080p version (sometimes the video pauses for a few seconds then resume, sometimes the quality downgrades in order to keep playing). I don't experience this nearly as much with the non-live video streams. So, I think it may be on MotoGP servers' end. I'm really happy with the easy set up and use of the Chromecast. I have a Roku on my primary TV, but couldn't justify the cost of another one for a second TV and for such a limited purpose. The Chromecast offers such great value; however. And it's so easy to use and works really well that I think I'm actually going to buy one for my primary TV, as well. (The YouTube channel on Roku is unreliable, not playing HD when HD is available, and only supports one account, and a few other issues. Plus, then I can watch MotoGP on my main TV, too!) I would 100% recommend to a friend. I think these would make great gifts, too--provided your gift recipient has an Android device."
2613	Monroe	5	Awesome product!	I bought my son a Chromecast for Christmas last year and he liked it so much he asked for another one this year so he could have one for his other TV. Best Buy had the best price two years in a row!
2614	Luislikescars	5	Dope device for Android users	If you don't have a smart tv this will convert it into one. Best part is I stream movies straight from my phone to my tv with screen cast. I love it
2615	RckyMntMom	5	Great item	This is a great stocking stuffer at an amazing price!!
2616	Gekay	5	Works great...	I already own a Chromecast previous version, but this one is sleek and added to my bedroom tv. Works great with YouTube streaming and happy with it so far.
2617	Kevinvrules	5	Great price and fairly easy to use!	I bought this while I was visit g a friend and there was no cable or anything to connect an iPhone to a tv, so I ran to beautiful buy and purchased the regular 2nd gen chromecast. And downloading the app and going through the set up process, which was pretty easy honestly, I was able to stream Netflix and Hulu no problems. The only minor Issue i have had was being unable to cast m screen but I use an iPhone, not an android device. Overall great product
2618	abhatt	5	Great product!	Very nice product with no issues at all. Able to cast from both Android and iOS devices without any issues. Recommended to all who needs it.
2619	Anner	5	Great little casting	The google chrome is great for casting! I can cast literally anything on my phone! Love this product. Only downside is that my port is a bit high so it weighs down a bit.
2620	Dgx5k2t	4	It works as described	Have to unplug to reset every time when connecting
2621	Bailey	3	Was useful for its purpose	We used the google chrome, however with our available internet service the Roku was a better fit
2622	Ravi	5	Superb	This device is Very useful and Simple for casting.
2623	Kpatel	5	Very nice google is best	Works verygood with not smart TV very cheap product with compare to New Smart TV. it is best for everything now my old TV is smart TV
2624	JimbyJones	5	Simple but powerful.	Love my Chromecast. It's incredibly easy to set up and turns your basic TV into a smart TV. It also integrates in nicely with my Google Home system.
2625	Chit0s	5	Great	Easy to connect...and even easier to use stream media from your phone directly to your tv
2626	Lily	5	Perfect for streaming	I have 3 of the Chromecast all over my house. I recommend this for everyone !
2627	alanxc	5	Great value	This device is really awesome. If you don't have a smart TV, this is definitely the way to go. It was really easy to set up and it is really easy to stream videos onto it from my phone.
2628	Victor	4	Good but highly dependent on smartphone	The product is great - as advertised - for casting shows and movies from apps that work with it on phones, from chromebooks, and from some tablets. It doesn’t work with amazon devices. It has no remote, so less tech savvy people like my 71 year old dad have real trouble using it. For smartphone-adept people it’s fairly easy to use.
2629	GHshah	5	Love it	Love it... works great with my tv. Not all my TVs are smart TVs so this makes it easy to cast to other TVs
2630	Andie	5	Love it!	Love it! Got it to work with my google mini! Love casting my phone to the tv and the connection is amazing!
2631	Ordaz25	4	Great for streaming	Makes everything simple and easy to access for your not smart TV
2632	Nick	5	Great Product	This is a nice device for casting your android phone, similar to Amazon Fire TV. I got this one during Black Friday sale but regularly it still gives you a lot for your buck.
2633	pchang205	4	Not quite sure what I expected	Maybe I was expecting more of an interface with apps like an Apple TV or a fire TV, but it just takes whatever u sling from your device. Works well for what it is, just not quite what I was expecting. Definitely keeping it, but I wouldn’t buy another.
2634	shradha	4	Its good	Helps me cast apps on my TV which makes it easy to view
2635	TheBaroness89	5	great product	love this little thing... stream directly to my big screen from tablet or phone. YouTube, personal movies etc. great product
2636	mi502	5	Works great casting from phone or PC	Chromecast works great if you want to put whatever you are watching from your Chrome browser. It also works great from phone apps that support Chromecast. It's pretty easy to set up, too. Not complicated at all to set up or to use. Even novice tech users should be able to figure this out.
2637	jason	5	Love it	Easy to set up and works great. I love the screen mirroring! Can't beat the price. I use it every day
2638	Agroup	4	Very good	Works great for playing movies, broadcasting pictures and videos for the whole family.
2639	Kyle	5	Easy to use	Chromecast works great. Easy to set up and stream. Works with iPhones and iPads no problem. I have the google home and google mini and it works seamlessly with both using my voice or iPhone / iPad.
2640	Case	5	Love casting	Love the ability to turn any tv into a smart TV. Can cast Netflix and vudu. Love it. Not sure about the new design yet. It's different.
2641	Masontrisch510	5	It’s amazing	I love this cromecast. It’s my first one and very convenient and user friendly
2642	Gasman	4	Works great!	Easy to set up and use, would recommend this product
2643	Simmonsmw	5	Excellent	I upgraded from the original Chromecast and this is so much better. It's faster loading up and can play movies quickly.
2644	Dmnau	5	Easy to use	Truly a plug and play device, it works great with my Android phone
2645	Vishal	5	Best casting gadeget ever	Bought it for the deal at Best Buy and love it. Very easy to cast from my phone and computer.
2646	Basketball	5	Great	Very great product we enjoy it a lot and easy to set up.
2647	Dude	5	Thumbs up	"Very easy to set up and use
Connects via Bluetooth, works great"
2648	RobM	4	Chrome cast works great	Easy to setup and use. And it was on sale at Best Buy when I purchased it.
2649	chasedream	3	it's ok	it's just ok, you probably only need one for your lifttime
2650	geotu	5	Great gift	Chromecast is great for viewing so much content and personal media. It's also great for TV watching parties. Makes for a great gift, especially during the holiday sales!
2651	FotoG	5	smart-up your dumb tv	i have yet to buy a smart tv but this is a great solution for watching internet content on my 'dumb' (not internet connected) tv. easy setup and easy to use
2652	KCountry	4	Purchased as a gift for family member	We have not use this product yet as it is a Christmas gift for my son. We have heard good things about it, hoping it works as stated.
2653	Zabrina	4	Love it!	I am able to easily show what's on my phone onto my tv.
2654	39goldens	5	Very good product that lived up to my expectations	I reviewed before purchasing and it is excellent as expected..
2655	coltsrock11	5	Great device	Excellent for streaming to your tv. Great for YouTube, Netflix, etc
2656	Laura	5	Easy to use!	This product is incredible. So easy to use and gives us everything we were looking for. Highly recommended.
2657	Goose	5	Great product	Really easy to use and allows me to stream all kinds of content from my phone. Works well with my iPhone and even lets me stream content from certain websites
2658	helios025	5	Great for beaming chrome tabs	Needed another chromecast for a different TV, and this works great. It is in a room quite a distance from the router, but has no trouble playing content such as netflix or videos from chrome browser tabs.
2659	Brandon	3	So so	I got this product for a great price. The lack of a visual user interface is a real challenge for this product that I have not been able to overcome.
2660	mimsus	5	Perfect for teens	I have two FireSticks and one Chromecast. The Chromecast is better for my teenage daughter who likes to stream Netflix and YouTube on her Iphone and Ipad. She likes the ability to control the TV with her phone and switch seamlessly between the TV and her device. It's a much better transition than with the FireStick. Picture is great .
2661	Ssmart	5	Great to convert any tv to smart tv	I added this to my tv, I love all google products.cant go wrong with them.
2662	Smitty73020	3	Good device for the price.	With the Google Chromecast you get a good device for the proce. That said i wouldn't pay anymore than the listed price. The device has limited uses and the software operating the device needs work, as does the Google Home app. We use this device frequently with Android and Apple devices and have had it lock up on several occasions since purchasing this device last month. That said for the money if you want to stream YouTube videos this device will do the job fine.
2663	Toz12	5	Great for music	Great for streaming music through the entire house.
2664	frankie70	5	Google Chromecast Black	Love it! Works great with the Google Mini! Gonna purchase another one soon for my other Google Mini. I have no regrets whatsoever!!
2665	Kevin	4	Great for simple setup	I have a few Chromecasts in the house, which are great for basic functions like screen mirroring, casting tabs off a laptop, queuing videos, etc. It's not like a Roku or FireStick, i.e. it will only cast content you share to it via WiFi and doesn't have apps native to the device. Most of its functions are native on newer model smart TVs, so don't bother if your smart TV was made any year since 2016.
2666	Mari	5	Great product	Great for gifting daughter loved the product very useful
2667	Laura	5	Google quality!	I have not enjoyed youtube until now. this Chromecast is perfect to cast videos from my computer or mobile. Works as expected.
2668	theu	4	Easy to use	Nice addition to a non smart TV. Set up is easy and using is just as easy
2669	JonA	5	Usefull gadget	It’s very handy not to have to run an hdmi cord from a computer to the tv.
2670	jaimemendez35	5	Good connection	The connection is good, kind of annoying tonintall but ok nonetheless
2671	paulyuan1219	5	Excellent product	This product is convenient to use when compared with apple tv.
2672	Foxtrot	5	works great with Google Home & Google Mini	I have a Google home and this works great to cast anything on the TV that is on youtube just by asking Google, you can cast Netflix very easily through the app or via voice on a Google Home or Mini. You can cast a lot of content to your TV via your smartphone or tablet. Works great with Android and Apple IOS. I have 3 of these and they are great.
2673	Eric	5	Great product	I stream almost everything so this makes it so convenient. Haven't had any hiccups with connection and great quality
2674	jbrown	3	Not sure it's that much different from the old one	I purchased this one after reading some reviews and some people said it was faster adn dropped the stream less. It works slightly better but the quality of the stream is low and sometimes still pauses while the video is playing on the Macbook. I have a new nighthawk routher and 150mbp download internet and 25 upload so it's not the internet. I did read there was an HD version so I'm wondering if that one works better. It's ok for the price, just don't expect too much.
2675	DevAuto	1	Horrible Performance	"I really wanted to like this. It was very difficult to just get up and running, as it REQUIRES you and the Chromecast to be on the same wireless network. It is NOT possible to just connect directly to the device and configure it for streaming. 

Once actually configured, performance was miserable. I could not get anything with video to stream smoothly, everything was ""choppy"". To make a bad thing worse, most of the time the audio was out of sync with the video, maybe this was due to the choppy nature of the connection. 

As I don't have these issues with streaming to my Roku or Amazon devices, I think it must be the Chromecast device itself."
2676	Lily	5	Must Have!	The Google Chromecast is a MUST HAVE at my home, It enables me to watch anything and everything that I want without the need of a cable provider!
2677	MonkillaJr	5	Great casting device.	This is great if you want to case your smartphone to your TV.
2678	Kentilsha13	5	Makes any TV Smart	Love using my chromecast. I do not have cable, so using this device to stream anything is so useful. It works perfectly once on the home network and anyone that is connected can send music or videos to this device.
2679	SQADUP	5	Cut the Cord	"Great way to ""Cut the Cord."". Installed on every TV in my house."
2680	SQAD	5	"Great way to ""Cut the Cord"""	Every TV in my house has one connected unless it has the Chromecast already built in. All you need is a USB & HDMI on the TV to power then you have to plug and use electricity. I recommend!
2681	Montalviio22	5	Great device.	It works pretty good and has many apps that works so good for my entertainment needs.
2682	ASJr	3	Good unnecessary device.	Nowadays, with SmartTvs I don't see a reason to buy it! It is good to work with Google Home devices, just it.
2683	Wc2w	5	Nice upgrade from the original	Overall this new version of Chromecast is a nice upgrade. Seems to operate faster with less lag time.
2684	RooLicious	5	Great streaming	We have bought a new TV and needed another one of the screenbeam devices and I decided to try out this mini version. It is cheaper, smaller, and works even better than the pro version probably because of the latest firmware. I have never updated the firmware on the pro version since I bought it over a year ago; but it still works better than the in-built widi receiver of my newest LG 5k smart TV. The only thing is that my old TV I bought in 2005 does not have the HDMI slot on the front or side, so I had to use the HDMI extender provided to expose the receiver for better connectivity with my phone (Samsung Note Edge).I watched 2 hour long video on the first try and it has never dropped the signal or delayed the audio. The connecting takes about 5 seconds. If you have PC's, Android devices and TV with a HDMI slot, this is now a MUST-HAVE item. I am buying one more for my sister.
2685	Mona	5	Good for the HD TV's	It works great for all the HD tv's, though it may not work for 4K tv's. There is no problem with the device, It works great.
2686	Squriel	5	Easy set up	Makes cast super easy, I had trouble trying to cast straight to my tv but this solved my issues
2687	Eric	5	Google Chromecast	This is the 4th chromecast I bought, and the first 2nd generation model. I put it in each of our TVs and use it a lot for streaming YouTube to our TVs. It works very well.
2688	AndyMayCry	3	Still not convinced	I bought it because I use some apps that are not available for Roku, but the fact that this is not a standalone device, meaning that you have to stream content from elsewhere (laptop or mobile device)... I still prefer other similar devices such as Roku Stick or Amazon TV Fire Stick
2689	Divesh	5	Good works with all digital device	Very nice product. Works fine with iPhone, laptops. Very easy to setup and cast the videos.
2690	Cindy	5	great tool	i have the original chromecast. needed to make a few more tv's into smart tv without spending a ton of money. Chromecast's are awesome. easy to use and so reasonably priced
2691	miguel	5	great	excellent... love it i used to cast Netflix.......
2692	DMGamer	5	Easy to Use	I had one from before and wanted one for my other TV. They are easy to use since most mobile apps have a Chromecast feature. It works well with most Android devices (uncertain about Apple devices).
2693	Nithy	5	Great product	Does what it is intended for. i have been casting from my laptop as well as mobile and casts without any issues except occasional buffering. but, overall good and satisfied.
2694	krain755	5	My favorite streaming device at a great price	I had a 1st generation Chromecast and I needed one for my projector so I jumped at this $20 one on Black Friday. Easy to setup and worked as it should. Chromecast tabs are the best and work great with a wide variety of apps.
2695	MrsA	5	Love the Chromecast!	So easy to set up and use to stream videos! We have multiple chromecasts so we appreciate we can name each one and not get confused.
2696	Skywalker2016	5	Great purchase!	I love my Chromecast! For such a simple device at such a great price it works really well. Between chromecast and Roku, I have cut the cord and I couldn’t have been happier. Highly recommend it!
2697	XBOXMASTER	5	GOOD DEVICE	"GOOD TO STREAM YOUR PHONE TO YOUR BIG TV
AND GOOD DEVICE TO VIEW THINGS BIGGER"
2698	R186Singh	5	Good one if you don't have smart tv	Great product for non smart tv to play your video on TV.
2699	ASR26	5	Another Dream Stream Machine	Got my first ChromeCast as a gift and used to broadcast movies/shows from my laptop to my flatscreen. Purchased this second one to connect to my growing Google Home system to make playing Netflix on both sets easier. Just speak the command and I'm good to go. Only been a few weeks with the new Chromecast but so far so good.
2700	nativehellraiser	5	Its Google!	Google products are well know to plug, play and work. This cast device is no different. You will find it fun to ask movies and not have to use a DVD player again.
2701	seulmer	5	Easy to use and does what you'd expect	Streaming to any device with an HDMI in is super easy. Can mirror devices too to play on a larger screen. There are competing devices that probably offer most of the same features, but this one has been totally perfect for what I need.
2702	tmjack04	5	Love It	I love my Chromecast. I purchased one for each tv and synced them to my Google home to control it. I got rid of my cable and I only have the internet. I cast everything from my phone or tablet. Best decision every.
2703	Bobby567	3	Streaming device with so much potential	This device is a glorified streaming bridge between the user the TV. This device could probably be more than a streaming device but so far that’s all that I have been able to find with this device.
2704	jgphaneuf	5	Works like a chromecast should	Have not had any issues .. works like it should and has not broke yet !
2705	Jess1597	5	Great Product	I have an older tv that does not have smart tv capabilities. This product allows me to cast from my phone onto the tv. I have had no issues.

2709	Chalala	5	Great	This is great product. Easy to connect didn't have any problems
2710	Tobin	5	It is great	It great especially for phone mirroring it is necessary if you do not have a Samsung tv
2711	Feedbacb	5	Excellent	Excellent product. Would recommend to friends. Recommend again
2712	TamaraR	3	Good	I set up everything follow instruction, including internet Name and Password. After that I found that my smart phone could not find my internet and goes directly to TV's internet. I disconnected device from TV and everything restored. So that means I cannot use both together. that is weird and not expected from Google.
2713	JOTT	5	Works well & easy to use...once you learn	Easy enough to install. Would be nice if it could be powered by the USB port. After experience with the 1st generation Chromecast, using the device is really easy.
2714	LouisEN	4	Great Device for the price	Chromecast is easy to set up, easy to get on and syncs well with google home mini
2715	Gladdy	5	Excellent chromecast!	Works incredible! Power Point Presentations from classes have an amazing HD images and great colors which make them easy to remember and understand better.

2718	Sams	5	Great Product for Casting	Very nice to have this product for casting from mobile or laptop to TVs. Easy set-up and no issues. Works great
2719	SaucySauce86	5	Great integration	"I bought the Chromecast because I wanted to have easier access to streaming movies and music through my entertainment center (via my television). I also purchased Google Home mini. Side note: The two of those work really well together, by the way. 

I would highly recommend the Chromecast to anyone who is looking for an easy and cheap solution to streaming music and video through their television/entertainment system. I bought mine for $20 through black Friday deals. $20 well spent."
2720	Techie137	5	Great product	I have started to stray away from tv services and move towards videos and online videos. Keeping a minimal range of devices to one's self is great and streaming straight from the phone is great.
2721	rbmwheeler	5	It works great!	We love them! We bought 3 of them! They work great!
2722	SamMahankali	5	Good one	Good one, plug and play....very easy to setup and get it work
2723	prankstercat	5	Perfect gift for a teenager	Smooth easy transaction, quick shipping. Highly recommend
2724	ronchx	5	Works Great!	Does what it says it does! Play something on my tablet or phone and watch it on the TV. (works differently on iPhone vs. Android phone with certain apps other than youtupe, netflix, hulu, etc...so google exactly what you are hoping to achieve for your phone first)
2725	gerry	5	just what we wanted!	just what we wanted! Use it everyday....easy to cast from I-pad to tv. Recommended to other family members and now they have them too.

2730	sexibeast	5	Chromecast works well	been using Chromecast a few weeks now. set up was ok and managed to connect to my 5g network. picture quality is great. I cast from Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung 8 inch tablet. works every time.
2731	tsunamee	5	works as expected	Added unit to a second television since 1st worked well.
2732	Eman	5	Want a fancy tv, by this instead.	"Sure newer tv's are all the rage right now. Oled and the newer full array 4k tv's, come with smart tv options. But if you bought a tv before smart tv became a standard. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a chromecast. It literally is like having a giant smart phone. My older tv is know a smart tv. And I can hold off on buying a tv for a little longer. Now I can watch Netflix, hbo go, and etc. On my 55 in tv. Also if you pair it with a Google home product, it becomes a hands free tv. You can turn it on or off. And tell it to open Netflix or other apps on chromecast. If your on the fence about buying the a new tv, and just do yourself a favor and buy a chromecast. Trust me people are amazed when tell the Google home turn on tv. And then tell it to ""play Netflix series narcos on tv"". And boom the tv does it. People's always drop. Just buy it."

2742	Dood	4	Same as the first verse	"Similar to first gen, better screensaver images. I have a first gen, and now this one - both seem to do the same things - not a whole ton of difference - other than this being more flexible than the original ""stick"" design. I have an ultra-low-profile bracket/mount, so i needed the flexible version. Not used on a 4k TV though, so I cant comment on that level of resolution quality - but no complaints, works great."

2904	AKAMOM	4	Easy to use	A great gadget. Easy to use. I would definitely recommend.
2905	EJ6744	4	delightful experience with robo sound	It is explicitly different experience than mobile version of digital assistant. This google mini works with other google products or some limited vendors products. It took little time to learn our needs and queries. I hope in future it will get sync up with more devices.

2906	Hank	4	Good price	This product is a good way to stream live television
2907	johnwick	5	great product	love being able to stream from my android phone to my tv and using google home with it.
2908	harrkev	4	Good, but limited	"First, this is not a general-purpose stand-alone streamer (like a Roku). It acts sort of as a virtual 2nd display from either a phone or a PC. From an Android device, you can ONLY stream from apps that have a ""stream"" button built-in. Most media apps have this, but Amazon Video does not (Amazon being a jerk in an effort to get you to buy a Fire TV). From a PC, you can ONLY use this is you use Chrome, but you can either transmit one Chrome tab, or your entire desktop. If you really need to get a web page on your TV, and you use Chrome, this is a great choice. Otherwise, a Roku (such as the inexpensive Roku Express) is worth the extra money. If you really need to pinch your pennies and can live with the limitations, then this works fine. Just check to make sure that your desired app supports casting. (I did not test this with any Apple devices)."
2909	Monique	5	Chromecast - so fun!	"My brother was visiting and said this is a must have. Use to ""mirror image"" from my phone to the tv. No more. Great product and so easy to use."
2910	Jann	5	useful	this is useful gadget if you want to a fluid transition from your mobile device to your tv.
2911	Beautt101	5	Everybody should have one	Chromecast is a great product that anybody who travels should have. It's easy to use and highly functional
2912	Iceberg	4	Works as promised	This is a handy device, especially if you have an iPhone and want to stream one of your favorite clips to your television and don't have an Apple tv.

2914	Kish	5	Great product	Great product... Got it for a great price. It works on my phone (S6 edge) and my wife's phone (i6) seamlessly
2915	dollz999	4	Works great!	We have mainly apple devices at home and we were always looking for the lightening adapter (since we all kinda share one). Since everyone needed it at home, one of my family member bought this and it works very well! Now we don't have to fight for the lightening adapter anymore because we have this at home and I can just send my video to TV with my phone without plugging anything in.
2916	Hollister53	4	Useful!	Originally purchase this to stream content directly to my TV; found out that my TV has chromecast built in so I decided to use it for my DENON amplifier. This works well to stream audio directly to my 5.1 speaker system (connected to the amplifier via HDMI).
2917	BIGR1	5	Great Great	Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great
2918	Patrick	5	Great product!	What more can you say about Chromecast products! Easy to use!

2920	SmartShopper96	5	Works great for what I needed.	This works great for my bedroom TV and integrates with the Google home application. Very easy to cast with the app from my phone.
2921	DadeMurphy	4	Great streaming device	Chromecast is a great streaming device. works great. Can beam directly from your phone to your TV. Honestly, it does everything that all of the competing devices do. The part that put this over the top for me was the fact that you can use your google home to trigger the chromecast to play a show or movie from one of several services offered on the chromecast.
2922	dummble	5	I love it	chromecast is great if you know how to use them. They do not come with a remote, so you need to either use your phone or computer or google home to send content. But once you get past this they are very powerful.
2923	JBoii5	5	Great casting device.	Lost my first Chromecast so needed a new one. Nice new design too.
2924	Judy	5	Great	Like to talk to my Google to change the stations. Loveit
2925	anna	5	Love the graphics	Still learning the device, so far it is interesting
2926	Patthesupreme	5	Great product	Great product for transitioning from cable to paid streaming services. Made the process easier.
2927	Nanda	5	The best casting device	This casting device is the best one that I have seen in the market so far, its so fast, quick and easy to setup. using it from past 3 years with no issues.
2928	NatureZ	5	It's convenient	This little thing is convenient if you want to stream on a TV while you can use your devices to do other things at the same time.
2929	Chris	4	Awesome!!	I love using this to listen to Pandora or watching Netflix. It's great when you don't have a Smart TV!
2930	Technology	5	Great casting device	The last Chromecast was great but it’s lack of a 5G band wasn’t that great but this new chromecast is FAST.
2931	rayray27834	4	Nice	I chrome everything to this. Love it can't wait to discover more
2932	Badri	3	Good	It's just a little cable to power the chromecast and I paid too much for it. It works and handy if your tv has a usb port.
2933	SoCalDad	5	Great product	The Google Chormecast is easy to use. Now I can cast YouTube, Hulu to the TV from my cell phone. Nice!
2934	Hugginsmcgee	4	Same as the old one	I already had an old “original” chrome cast of you will for about 2 years and I loved it the only thing I didn’t like is that sometimes the chrome cast wouldn’t appear on the tv when I tried to use it, so I thought it might just be because it’s old. So on Black Friday I purchased this new one and it’s the exact same thing as the old one. No differences except for the body of the device.
2935	pinktulips1972	5	Great new gadget for the home!	New gadget for the home & still learning its many uses.
2936	Toyota	3	Just okay	The device does what it’s suppose to do but I’m not really impressed
2937	JoshK	5	Awesome	As a Google user they are fantastic. Just got my second.
2938	anjaneya	4	Good device for projecting moves	Most of the smart TVs are already support projecting screen from Apps. The device is very good to project laptop chrome browser as well which is needed to watch movies which do not exist on Netflix, Youtube etc.
2939	Krys	4	Nice little device!	Ridiculously easy set up. Works good with the pixel 2xl. No lag or issues so far. This device makes streaming online content a breeze. Happy with the purchase.
2940	rako95	5	Chromecast saved my old tv!	I put my old tv in my gym to watch regular tv. But thanks to chrome cast i can do so much more. netflix, spotify, youtube, and etc.....
2941	Jaypow05	4	Works fairly smooth	The Chromecast works pretty smooth with most streaming apps. The voice commands with the Google home work fairly well once you know what commands to say.
2942	callmeageeth	4	Great way to watch shows but no remote	"I like the Google Chromecast integration with Google Home and I like being able to control things with my phone, but sometimes I need a remote. Don't get me wrong the Chromecast works well and seemless, and while most people always have their phones with them, I do prefer to use a remote. I just use Chromecasts because I'm invested in the Google ecosystem and Google Home. 

At the end of the day, if you use Google Services, this is the best (I think only real) option. But if you have no major investment in any other ecosystem, I would give pause to the no remote thing. It's a fundamental change in how we watch TV; easy to get past, but a minor annoyance nonetheless."
2943	tmed19	5	Works Great	Easy setup and works great for a camper or really any tv that you want to stream to.
2944	debo7575	3	Ok	Not what I thought.couldnt view ever thing from my phone to the cast
2945	Naba	4	Great for value	A good quality streaming Device. Easy to install. Great value product. I like this product quality
2946	DrGoldin	5	should be in every household	You plug it into your TV's HDMI port, you follow the on-screen instructions (install the Google Home app on your smartphone, connect the Chromecast to your home network--takes maybe five minutes) ... and start casting! It's a no-brainer, five-star product that simply works. Everyone should have one.
2947	Maria	5	Great for non technology savy	I love it, easy setup.I plan to purchase two more as Christmas gifts.
2948	treceloco	5	Good quality	I am fan of this type of device makes my dumb tv smart
2949	Sysrav	1	Had high hopes	"I was so excited thinking that it would work best with my Google pixel 2 but I was so disappointed, it works 1 out of 5 times. It connects using WiFi and It wouldn't work on both 2.5 n 5 GHz
I had to reset my modem n router to make it work, sometimes that does not help either."
2950	Alex	5	Good quality and easy set up.	Good quality and easy set up. Working very well and don't need special education. Only need good Wi Fi speed.
2951	Kevin	5	Excellent value	If you're willing to create a login this can be an amazing value
2952	momo	5	i love it!	i had the roku for a few years now, i mean i like it ,but it was always laggy, so this year i decided to finally get my hands on this lil bad boy, and let me tell you, i like it sooo much better than the roku! Its faster, it does not lag what so ever and theres just more option to it and less hassel to deal with. I like it alot.

But slow at times.. :/"
2959	Sunflower	5	Very useful product	We would like to watch YouTube on TV. This chrome cast works perfectly for us. And very easy to use!
2960	bstbuy	5	Great addition	This item is a great addition to any non smart TV. Plug it in and you can stream netflix, hulu, etc from any smartphone, tablet, or computer to your tv. It is great for quickly showing things to family or allowing you to spend time with your family to stream TV shows and movies. For the price you can't go wrong to have at least one of these in your home.
2961	Mike	5	Great for viewing video's on your TV	This item takes time to setup but it is well worth the time, it makes it easy to watch videos and other chromecast items on your TV
2962	Sarcastic74	5	Great Device	Very useful in my room. I can easily project anything from my iPad to the TV
2963	CasualUser	5	Worth the money	I want to buy it so to cast BBC video from computer onto TV. It is easy to set up with instructions provided. Five minutes and it is done. Good product.

2968	TimT	5	Streaming	Great little item that allows the kids to stream videos and other fun shows to the TV.
2969	Demanic667	5	Great product	This thing is amazing. It essentially turns your tv into a smart tv but with more options. You can wirelessly connect your phone to it an watch whatever it is on your tv. More apps or websites had a chromecast button but if they dont, then you can just mirror your phone screen to your tv.
2970	Ram1	5	Its very good so far	Best buy is the brand and everyone likes it. I prefer
2971	shinn16	5	Very nice for streaming	I didn't think I would like not having a dedicated remote for this device, but it is actually pretty nice! Plus Google home let's me control it with my voice so it is very cool to use!
2972	Evolution808	5	Use it daily.	Possibly the best media purchase I have made since my TV. It has all the other apps my Samsung Smart TV doesn't carry, and I can also mirror my computer or phone. Best part, it's very affordable.
2973	mitch	5	Good buy	This is replacing my first generation chrome cast. Have been happy with my chrome cast.
2974	Organicsoul	5	Easy to use	This does everything I need. Wanted something easy to use to cast to my tv and this was perfect !

2978	Charlo	5	Great addition to any media center	Love it. Does what it's supposed to do and works well with all Google Home products.
2979	AGJC	5	Easy setup	I used the enclosed usb cable to get power from the television itself instead of the provided power supply. This made for a clean hidden setup which I was looking for. The entire device can hide behind the TV without plugging into an outlet. Easy to setup...it walks you thru the process. I did it using my cell phone when required. You can use a tablet or laptop as well. Seemlessly links to Google home app as well. I mostly will be using this to cast pictures from my google cloud account. My other Google devices all detected this unit without a problem. Great product.
2980	Matthew	5	Chromecast just works	I really like the Chromecast I got. Just playing around with it for a couple of hours showed it will be a great device to stream to my tv.

2983	Nanaaudi	5	Easy to use	Recommended by co worker and was as good as he's said. Just plugged into my tv and had direct tv from my phone on the big screen
2984	Aave	5	Nice to have	We have other streaming devices but the chrome cast made it very simple to use.
2985	Robber23	5	Why did I wait?	"I should have bought one of these years ago.

Stream works great, way better than hooking up your computer to tv, like in the past.

We love watching our videos from our phones on the big screen and love the fact that our wedding video can be streamed on the tv and sound bar.

Definitely recommended especially at the sales prices."
2986	Kevinlee721	5	Great product	Bought a 4k TV as soon as it came out, but lost some functionality. So needed a Chromecast for casting.

2990	Marshall	5	Great for casting to my TV	Just plug this into my TV HDMI port and I'm ready to cast from pretty much anything my smartphone or laptop's Chrome browser. It's fun to view pictures from my smartphone or laptop on the big screen. I'm also able to cast my music from my browser to the TV.
2991	GlobalTraveler	5	Great Steaming Device for the Price	The best thing I like I about this is the ability to mirror laptop and other mobile devices

2993	travis	5	Great product	I have owned three Chromecasts, and they have all been great!

2996	gmartine	4	Excellent device at a great price!	I got this on a super sale and grabbed it. Perfect!
2997	alrightmommy	5	Love this thing	This is my 3rd one. Now I have one in each room with a tv. Family loves it as well!!!
2998	Bill	5	Watching movies	Simple to use. We use it on a regular basis watching movies and shows. Kids play YouTube through it.
2999	iRod	5	A must have gadget!	We have tried many other ways to cast videos to big screen tv with little success. Plug this in and BANG! Effortless casting of screen. Should have bought one earlier!
3000	Dwayne	4	ChromeCast	I decided to cut the cables. ChromeCast allow me assess to all my shows.

The only thing I do that use my cellphone ( just download the apps on your phone) open the channel and connect your chromcast and enjoy.
3005	TiVoOTAUser	3	must have strong WiFi and compatible phone or pad.	"You must have strong WiFi and compatible phone or pad....
My RCA Pad and LG Tracfone and an older Intel Pentium Windows 10 OS laptop are not compatible. Trying to Cast from these devises displays a note: ""This device is not optimized for casting using Google Chromecast"".. My newer Windows laptop easily casts from Google's Chrome Browser."
3006	Mushr00m97	5	Amazing Little Device	This device is great. Want to stream music on your TV in a snap? Want to watch YouTube videos on a huge screen? The Chromecast has so many more functions and is as simple to use as it can get.
3007	Happyshopper1	5	This is good	If you have an older model TV this. Is a cool gadget great price at Best Buy !!!!
3008	denzal	4	Great Gift	Bought as a gift for my daughter, she loves it :-)
3009	Jess	5	Works as expected from a cell phone	Easy to set up and cast from a phone or laptop. As long as you are all on wifi together share with ease.
3010	Trung	4	Good	Good item. I remcomend this one to everyone who like to watch sport
3011	Pmkool1	3	Could be better	I hooked this up behind my TV but it had trouble getting a wireless signal, until I hung it below the TV to get a better signal. The initial connection process was fairly easy to complete, which was nice. But the video casting didn't look that good when viewing an internet browser, such as when scrolling or viewing moving ads. Honestly, after using it a bit I'm not sure it was worth the purchase. My Bluray player and/or DVR works so much better that this product.
3012	Piano88	5	Love it	I just bought two more chrome casts to add to our bedroom TVs!!
3013	sdelain	5	Happy to cut the cable	Works well, allowing us to cut cable and stream the programming we wanted through Sling.

3018	Goot	5	Easiest way to cast from a phone or tablet	Second generation is a lot smoother and by far the easiest way to cast from a phone or a tablet.
3019	BridgettValentine	5	Excellent for kitchen screen	No cable needed; can even cast recipes while baking
3020	George	1	POOR	"Bad, very bad. Excellent image and audio quality.
Terrible control system through additional devices, (cellular, tables etc.)
The worst I saw"
3021	Maribel	3	Didn’t work for me	I bought it to use with my iPhone and I couldn’t get it to work at all. Then I tried it with an android phone and it wouldn’t connect to Netflix at all. I gave up on day 2 and returned it.
3022	Nguyen	5	Good	Easy install and cast fast. Good price and fast pickup time
3023	Roya	5	I hate my cable	On demand that my cable company has isn't the best. This little wonder I get to stay caught up on my shows
3024	yOshix6	4	Good addition to my smart home	Easy to install and use. Great with Google home speaker. Highly recommend
3025	BillLH	5	An Essential Component	"Works well as a smart HDMI input, with great integration of Netflix, YouTube Pandora and other streaming services. My favorite feature is the screen mirroring from my PC or phone. The screen saver feature works with my Google Photo albums and adds other photos that are in context with where I've visited. Freaky, but in context. I own three or four, keep one in my PC bag and have given away several as gifts. Just recently got Google Home Mini and now can speak commands like ""pause"" or ""go ahead 20 minutes"" and my Chromecast immediately obeys."

3030	Jain	5	Must buy in product	Bery good and handful and easy to use . Simple and smaller
3031	pitthr	5	Chromecast augments tv use	Adds increased functionality even to a smart TV by increasing the number of options for viewing as well as simplifying the ability to cast from a mobile device. Google has nailed it!
3032	Rick	5	Great chromecast and great price	I have the precios chrome cast version and is great, no issues at all, so I expect this one to be even better!

3080	Kumaran	5	Good	Goodnight excellent wow fantastic super Cool okokok
3081	ashw	5	Awesome	Everyone needs one of this at home. Easy to control TV
3082	Saurabh	3	Go for it only if you dont have a smart tv	"I got this for smart tv and after using it i realized that i actually don’t use it much. Pretty much all the apps via which you would like to cast are these days downloadable to your smart tv. 
The other downside is you cannot cast the photos and vidoes that you have on your phone. You need to buy 3rd party apps to do that...insane."
3083	dannyboy	5	Make your TV smart	Excellent and affordable way to improve your home entertainment system.
3084	Dbfrei	5	Better than any other I've used	Worked smoothly without any real setup. Higher quality video than my computer.
3085	Lulu	5	Great for Mirroring!	I bought this item specifically to mirror my pictures from my computer to the tv. It works great and definitely worth the price. I have so many other products that are supposed to do it, but just don’t work for one reason or another.
3086	BigBen78	5	Upgrade from 1st Gen	I'm finally upgrading my Gen 1 Chromecast. Nice performance improvement and better support for YouTubeTV.
3087	SLB28	5	Chromecast	Works great Samsung galaxy 8. You can cast the content from your phone to the TV.
3088	Aaaa	5	Works	I own previous version and this works great as expected.
3089	Punkynspanky	5	Can't go wrong with this!	This does not tie up your phone when casting, so you can use it for anything you need while the media is casting. I use it quite a bit for Google play music and Amazon Music, which is now 'castable' Excellent device!
3090	Fishgrease	4	It works.	Is the whole chromecast, using a tablet, phone or web browser thing ideal? NO... BUT IT WORKS. I bought this to compliment the Google home mini capabilities on my TV. Right now the features are lacking but nothing at fault of the chromecast itself - - it does what it is supposed to do and with out fail.
3091	Kanag	4	Good to have Chromecast handy	Good. Helping me to cast through google ihome much easier
3092	Mick	5	Better Than Expected	This device is better than I thought it would be. And not only does it handle video seamlessly but it also does audio way better than I thought. I can connect my Spotify directly to it and it works like magic. And using Google Play, once I select one of their stations, it handles the WiFi connection on its own. I can then turn off my phone and that saves my battery. The only gripe I have is that Apples iOS won’t cast it’s music library or podcast library to the chrome cast. Makes you always want to hate Apple for not playing well with others…
3093	Gary	5	Works like a charm	If you don't need 4K and your TV doesn't have Netflix built in, this is a low cost solution.
3094	Minh	5	Love it!	Love this product. Work extremely well on Desktop.
3095	DreaVee	4	Good product to watch netflix	I like rhe product. Just wish i could use other apps like facebook or snapchat on my tv screen
3096	GIRISH	5	VERY GOOD WORKING	VERY VERY VERY GOOD SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE . I PURCHASED ALL ELECTRONIC FROM BEST BUY
3097	Nick	5	great product	i use it to stream movies and all hd content, it works seamlessly as playing on the same device.
3098	Lori	5	Dirt simple to use!	My TV does screen mirroring but not casting. My phone does casting but not screen mirroring. Google Chromecast is what I needed to get my phone's content onto my TV screen. Simple to set up and use. Just like Google, Chromecast is very intuitive.
3099	Kean	5	Alternative to my roku.	Just bought this so I can try it with google mini. So far so good. But just dont know how to turn my tv when I tell googl mini to turn a certain channel.
3100	Jeff	5	Is amazing	Is so useful and is so cool ••••••••••••••••••••••
3101	skudela	3	good access for youtube tv, not the best picture	Needed a device to cast youtube tv. The device works well, very fast and easy to connect. Picture quality is not great. My Roku sticks seem to have much better quality. I plan to buy the Chromecast Ultra. Really like youtube tv.
3102	artleb	5	easy setup and use	Haven't fully used all capabilities, but the set up and initial use were quite easy.
3103	Chrissy	5	Love it	I can watch anything that's on my phone on the television
3104	Ashu	5	Excellent	I got this Excellent product for affordable price.
3105	Roy40	5	Best Casting Device	Chromecast works as advertised. No complains. Set up is like a breeze.
3106	Kraj	4	Good	Works well mostly. Lags a bit when doing screen mirror from Android
3107	Tip723	5	Great product	We love chrome cast!! This is a gift for our family
3108	Happyme	4	Great little device	Much to my surprise, this little device brings a whole new world to streaming online. Love it!
3109	Razer	4	Must have living room product for the TV	Made my smart TV even more smarter. Must have device in every house
3110	Jered21	5	Works great	Item works just as described. I'm not really sure what you would spend a ton more to get the same functionality.
3111	Lerae	5	Great to pair with google mini.	Simple to use. Just plug in to hdmi slot. Good price.
3112	Bestbutguy99	4	Needs more	Easy to use and setup would be great if it came with a means to mount to tv more reliably
3113	Harold	4	Works well	"Works very well..... But xfinity dosn't allow you to cast their services to another device...
And that I wasn't aware of before I purchased however still very useful it took awhile to upload its programming..."
3114	RickyB0813	5	Great with my google home!	We love the chromecast. Great Item! We use it daily!
3115	Dino	5	Awesome	Awesome product! Makes my viewing very convenient! works well with google home!
3116	Troy	5	Great for Streaming Video	Excellent device to stream Netflix and control from phone! Simple and easy to use.
3117	Sudh	4	Great	Good one seems very good offer which I got it. Good one
3118	Andre	5	Excelent	Perfect for what I need. I can have a smart TV wherever I want.
3119	Zach	4	Chromecast gets the job done.	This is great as long as you have something to mirror from. Unlike other streaming devices, this one needs another device to draw video from. The upside is I can tell the Google Home to play something on Netflix and it does it!
3120	Gannu	5	Good	I am big fan of google products and this cast really is awesome when u don’t have smart tv
3121	Rocky	5	Great	This item is good u have to get the free app I use it for my autistic son that loves music videos on music YouTube :)
3122	Rupam	5	Value for Money	Value for money. Totally worth it. Hassle free setup.
3123	3Bears	4	upgrade existing entertainment systems	Great way to add voice or phone controls to existing entertainment systems. We have 3 Chromes and 2 Rokus in the house. ...The Roku is better for sitting and feature surfing with a traditional remote. But, these are affordable enough to have both. Our 5 year old turns on/off her Netflix cartoons using Google Assistant and Chrome. ...And we can monitor or put timers on her usage.
3124	Terash	5	Excellent Streamer	Offers more streaming functionality than the one built in the Google Fiber TV box. Can turn it off or on using Google Home. Just gotta figure out how to name it properly.
3125	Mark	5	Great chromecast	Excelent product, I received like it was listed. Recommended
3126	Javier	4	Good	It's a nice device works good it would be a great Christmas present
3127	trudaveii	5	I see why everyone likes the Chromecast	It's an awesome device. Works well. Clear picture and clear sound.Very satisfied with it.
3128	Bizmax	5	Beast	It good. Buy now. I like. Have many of these peppered around my house.
3129	RYAN	5	Awesome nuff said	The original chrome cast was awesome this 1 is even better awesome for cord cutting
3130	BrandonSgr	4	Casting made easy	Casting is super easy and handy. Waiting for another product to have direct play instead of dependency on other device
3131	Djinnchaos	5	Love it	Have this down in my man cave. Perfect when I want to get away.
3132	Efra	5	Super fast, convenient, high quality	I love using chromecast for viewing netflix, you tube and cast my phone screen. It is very easy to use and also I have setup my tv to turn on if the chromecast start casting.
3133	mflores	5	Awesome Streaming !	This was very inexpensive and easy to set up. Gave me so many more viewing options !
3134	GroundedDumbo	4	Great for what it's meant to do	Works as advertised. Inexpensive, simple to control, integration with google assistant, whats not to like? Biggest complaint is that not all apps allow you to control the volume of the tv, and, on the apps (ie. Netflix) that do, the feature only works sporadically. This issue seems like it's the fault of the 3rd party app developers and not google, but since Google added this in their marketing of the device I'm counting it against them.
3135	Sachin	5	5 star !!!	"nice and necessary in each house, got it in a deal .
works great !!!"
3136	Kbsavaq4	5	Great	Always been a fan of Google Chromecast and this more updated version is no disappointment
3137	Wilsonb6	5	Great device and easy to set up	I have a Chromecast in every room. This device has made it extremely simple to send video from room to room in my home. Took less than 10 minutes to plug in and use.
3138	Kingk	5	Great	Very good product for 19 dollars. Streams very well.
3139	vladthespacemonkey	5	I can't fish, so I use this to cast	It's a nice little dongle and works smoother in some ways than our apple TV. I don't regret this purchase.
3140	YYan88	5	Good	Like it, because you can control your tv through google home.
3141	bbbyer	5	Great buy	I’m very happy with the purchase as it was on sale and a perfect gift
3142	Sasi	4	Best price	Best price available online en though it is a older version
3143	Bonda	5	Great	Great product and price. Beats all competition. Better than fire
3144	Xray14	5	Great Product	Love this. I travel for work and its great to have for the hotel rooms
3145	BharathPuppala	5	Chromecast for my youtube and other stuff..	Chromecast makes your life easy in playing the stuff like youtube videos, netflix and others from mobile or other devices and can see the same in TV without any delays. Casting is really good and i love the product.
3146	TomB	5	Nice Device	Google ChromeCast makes it easy to sling content from your phone to your television. Easy set up
3147	Oiball	4	Easy to use, works	The setup is pretty simple, apps are easy to find for streaming video and music. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but a good first or extra streaming device.
3148	aarya	3	Not the best device out there	There are better options in my opinion. Does not cast clearly. While there is no connectivity issue the image is not clear
3149	bestbuyonceaweek	5	Perfect for YouTubeTV	Old Chromecast did not work well with YouTubeTV.....this does. Perfectly!
3150	Gigi	4	Good	This product is good for the price. Good gift item for teens.

3157	Dule	5	Great deal for chromecast	Got this as a black friday deal for just 20$. Actually got 3 of them, works great!
3158	HowieBraces	5	"A ""must-have""!!"	Being that I am an Android fan, and have downloaded a ton of movies from Google Play, a Chromecast was the first accessory that I bought with my new flat-screen. Got to have one for movie watching during the long winter ahead!
3159	Mercer	5	Love it!	It is so easy to use and set up. I love being able to tell my Google Home to play a particular YouTube video, etc. So easy!
3160	TampaJoe	4	Chromecast awesome	This little guy is awesome! I'm no longer just sitting there staring at my phone to watch youtube. Plus i can tell Google home to pull up a video and it sends it to my TV.
3161	Pasem	4	Nice to have it.	I got it for better price on thanksgiving.its very helpfull
3162	bestbuyuser21	4	Faster than previous one	I already had chromecast and use it heavily all the time, this one I got for $19 bucks on Black Friday and it connects to my Google Home Mini. Now Kids don't have to ask me to search for their movie on Netflix they can just say it.
3163	JudyL	4	Convenient streaming device	For the price this is a great streaming device. I also have a Google Home and Android phone and they all integrate well. Not difficult to install and have used to stream Netflix movies.
3164	pchang205	4	easy set up	"super easy to set up, quality is good. to be honest, maybe i was expecting more of an interface like my apple tv or my fire tv (which i thought it would replace), but its more just an antenna for your device. 

one thing that im not sure i like but is better than the alternative is when the bandwidth gets low, it gets low res, BUT it doesnt pause to buffer like an apple tv or fire tv would, it just just smartly lowers it until its smooth. could be my device, but either way i think i appreciate that it keeps going, esp if youre not watching so much as playing something in the background."
3165	KCnh	4	Seems like a decent product just not for me	"I purchased several Chromecasts for my home due to the fact that we were going to ""cut the cord"". I did not research this item and didn't realize there was no remote and my phone would be my remote. This unfortunately would not work for family members visiting my home so I had to return them."
3166	Leandro	5	Functional	Super funcional / easy to use and very ok for the price.
3167	Edhdz	5	Awesome product	Got it for 19usd and works very well. I plugged into the kitchen tv.
3168	Trung	4	Pretty good but ran into some small issues	Setup and running fine. However, after done setting up, it doesn't show up on my Samsung LCD TV. I had to cut the power off at least 3 times in order to force it to get back and display. However, it still intermittently display blank even though power and everything seems fine. It is not as durable as previous versions.
3169	Salvador	5	Works great!	It was an easy setup and it works great. My whole family uses it to cast netflix or youtube videos. The quality is very good. I bought it on sale for $20 and it's a steal. I would even say that full price is worth it.

3180	Becca	4	Works well, but not with all apps	Works wonderfully, after some mild issues with staying connected to WiFi in the first couple weeks. Connects to linked apps quickly, but b/c licensing contracts, you can’t cast from built in Apple apps or Xfinity apps. Overall great product and easy to set up and use!
3181	Thiu	5	Easy to install	My first Chromecast. Easily installed and working just fine
3182	Googie	5	Great product!	I love my apple tv, but for the price of this google chromecast you can't go wrong!

3184	Louis	5	Second Cable Free	Can now cast shows to my bedroom TV without paying for an extra cable connection. Great!
3185	DKnight	5	Better than the first generation	Easy to use, easy to set up. Performs and maintains a stronger signal then the first generation editions . It’s worth the money.
3186	eddie	5	Awesome.	This is great to have in my bedroom. I can connect my lenovo tablet, HP laptop, or Dell desktop to my Television and stream all the content I want. The setup was easy and simple. The one thing is that after a little while of not using the chrome stream you have to reset it so the signal broadcast again. Overall an amazing product.
3187	Cristo	5	Excellent	If you do not have a smart tv, and you use an android phone, you should buy it, is really good and easy to use.

3198	ahjeck	5	Easy to set up, easy to cast Youtube videos!	Setting up this device couldn't be more simple once you install the Google Home app. It's how every device setup should be, painless! Once that's done, casting Youtube videos to the tv was so easy. I bought and set this up for my mom, even she can now cast videos without my help!
3199	MasterChief	5	Upgrade to the OG	What is an upgrade to my original Chromecast because it was on sale. Definitely worth the upgrade much faster responses and not as many bugs.

3230	Lokanath	5	Excellent Product	Now I am able to cast from my laptop and mobile. Also I liked that it doesn't need to connect to the power, you can connect it to TV's USB port and it will work. Great..

3236	Grey	5	amazing	legit one of the coolest things i have bought and really fun
3237	Usman	5	Great Compatibilty	"I use this with my Samsung TV. Amazing hardware and huge compatabilty list. I can pretty much cast anything and any app through my phone and laptop to my TV. The video and audio quality remains intact.
The installation and setup is very easy and once setup, casting is pretty straight forward. Dont need to be a techie to be able to use it. Everyone at my house uses it with ease."

Use this product as much as you can, then only you know the special qualities of it."

3242	Jamie	5	Turns any tv into a smart tv	I love chromecast and bought one for all my tvs. My friends want one for their tvs every time I use it.
3243	Frozenfrank	5	Effortlessly plays whatever I desire on the TV	"Setting up this product was extremely simple; Google goes to great lengths to obviate all potential issues. Especially when paired with a Google Assistant (as an APP, voice assistant, or other), playing music, TV shows, assorted YouTube clips and sporadic photos is spectacular.
My family is able to use the laptop to control the TV for a little bit, and then I can use my phone to select a song, and then my sister can as Google for some Anime... And Chromecast keeps up. 
One stellar device for bringing the family together in the living room and painlessly viewing internet content on the TV."
3244	Rana	5	Good and elegant	As mentioned in many review this is nice tech product
3245	Bisreal55	5	A really cool product	I purchased this product after visiting a family friend and was impressed by its capability. Very easy to setup and upload. The only downside for ME is using my phone as a remote(it does not have a remote). You can use it with any android and Apple device. It's small so you can travel with it and use it as long as you have internet access. It's an awesome streaming device to have. Would definitely recommend you to invest in one.
3246	Rajesh	5	Google Cast	I have connected it to my HDTV and now I can cast anything from my laptop browser onto the TV.
3247	ssll	5	Love it	Easy and affordable. You don't need couple thousand dollar Smart TV.
3248	unctarheel22	5	Excellent Casting	I love Google Chromecast. The casting feature is so easy to use and is seamless. I haven't had a connectivity issue at all, and my videos look super crispy on the 4k tv. I went with the regular Chromecast, and still looks amazing on my 4k tv. I like that the dongle has a magnet and attaches to the Chromecast to prevent some clutter.
3249	Bill	5	Great for non smart TV's	Bought this to stream to my TV. Works great! Was very fast and easy to set up since I already had a the Google Home app. Everything connected with no issues and was up and running in a few minutes. Haven't had any problems at all. Got this on black friday so the price and what you get is good. I'm able to stream you tube and movies from my iPhone and iPad. I have it connected via USB and my 5ghz wireless. Boot-up is fast when i turn on my TV and no problems with wireless connection.
3250	EHamlet	2	Eh	Unnecessary, I really don't need it. It will be returned. It works fine but isn't compatible with all programs. Works well with YouTube and Netflix but nothing for programs like Hulu.
3251	BaoNum	5	Very useful	Setup is easy and quick. It's very useful for a lazy person like me to watch my favorite anime on my TV when I don't feel like turning on my HTPC.
3252	benrayc	5	Cut the Cable	I love the Chrome cast. I use this for my YouTube TV account and it is awesome. It works flawlessly.

3258	Catcherman	5	Works Great	Not being real 'techie', setting this up to get it running wasn't too bad. Did need to reset router for everything to sync, but once that was done it works great.
3259	arjun	5	Great	Great product. Worked very well on the first install
3260	duchess	5	Cromcast works great.	Very efficient cromcast .... Streaming music in every room is really nice. Works well.
3261	Angelalynn89	4	Great Functionality	I use this device daily. It has great functionality and is able to be easily used by different programs. The only drawback I have encountered is that sometimes a specific device is not found when more than one Chromecasts are connected to a network
3262	Viper	5	Like mirroring options from my phone.	I really like using it for Hulu and Netflix and being able to use phone as remote is pretty cool.
3263	Carlos25	4	Gets the job done	Kind of tricky to set up. But once you get through that process, it does the job. I’m glad with the purchase.
3264	Khrono5	5	Excellent Streaming Device	I'd used one previously and was excited to get one for myself. The device is easy to connect to and get streaming! Would recommend
3265	RKar	4	Faster but some bugs still exist	Works faster than my first Gen chromecast and supports 5G WiFi. Product still has some bugs for streaming, though.
3266	Poncheit	5	Great performance	Very easy to use and fulfill my expectations !!!!!

3271	Venkat	3	Working fine	Product wise, its working fine, But i noticed that its not useful for normal use like, youtube, netflex ect.. to cast. I recommend you if you have any specific requirements then only you can go for this product.
3272	P51D	5	Great Product	Chromecast is great and very easy to setup. Works great with Google Home.
3273	redgt	4	Easy setup, works perfectly	"I already have 2 Amazon Fire Sticks on my TV's, but since I have 2 Google Home speakers and an Android phone, I decided to give the Google Chromecast a try.
It was very easy to set up and integrate with Google Home and my phone. It is easy to operate and performs as stated in the product description. However, I am giving it 4 stars because unlike the Fire Stick, it depends on another device such as your phone tablet or pc, to cast programming to the tv. I find it much more convenient to have the programming built-in and have a dedicated remote."
3274	Preacher	5	It's an awesome device.	I like the fact that you can watch anything from off any device that can connect to.
3275	gopro	5	great value	great value for a great product, always in tune with google products

3280	3MyB	5	Excellent device for first-timer	I needed to make a business presentation from my laptop to a monitor previously purchased at BestBuy, and I'm not tech-friendly, the Chromecast permitted me to make an excellent presentation to a prospect.
3281	TragicallyFearless	5	Chromecast makes connecting easy	I am pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of this little product! I like that I can remotely access everything I need form my phone. It just makes life easier having everything at one place.
3282	kumar	5	works great	Simply awesome - for 19.99$, it is definitely worth it.
3283	Liberty	5	Great for Cable Cutters	After cutting cable I went ahead and purchased this to make it easier to cast things from my phone or computer to the TV. Works very well with this and apps.

3291	Rsquared	5	Better than Bluetooth	This product was very easy to setup and very easy to use straight out of the box.
3292	Rebecca	4	It's good but I realized I don't really need it	It works. It's convenient, especially if you don't have an HDMI port in your laptop and you need to connect it to a TV. But if you own an adapter and HDMI cord, you don't really need this. An adapter costs a lot less than a Chromecast.
3293	Grace	5	Works very well	I have older tv and were not able to load YouTube. Cheap way to be able to use certain and not have to buy nee yv

3340	Boomer	5	Chromecast	Easy to set up, easy to use, works great for me !!!
3341	ryan	4	Good but not great	It's nice being able to control some things on my tv with my google home but some of the features are kind of glitchy. You can ask it to play a show from netflix on your tv and one time it will work and the next it will say it couldn't find that show or something like that. I still enjoy it and it's really handy at night to just be able to tell it to turn off the tv instead of having to go find the remote if I wasn't the one using it last.
3342	Krish	5	Good	Product is good and easy to use. I like this product.
3343	MyNickName	4	Better quality than expected	First time trying this type of device (cast) so I was nervous about the picture quality but it's better than what I expected.

3350	ReviewQueen	5	Great tool	Makes transferring from phone to tv easy. Have one on every tv
3351	LEOMODE	5	Great for cheap price	Good to stream your Android phones and play other contents at a cheap price. This is a good device and lifelasting product.
3352	jesusandsarai	5	Essential	The essential item to make that one dumb TV in the guest room all of a sudden worthy for your guests. Love it. Affordable. Easy to setup.
3353	eyerisfgr	5	love it	although I don't see a difference between the original chrome that first came out - I like this design better - seems more modern and sleek - the casting is great with no interruptions and all is easy to setup . we were up and running in about 5 minutes. great!

3358	sakthi	5	As the name goes Google	Great product. It would be great if google adds a option to pair a sound bar to chrome cast to play the sound directly from chromecast
3359	shac9	3	Improved but needs to improve more	We had an older chromecast and wanted to update it. This is improved from the last one in that there are fewer disconnects while using sling. However, it still drops off. For uses other than sling, it's probably not bad.
3360	AbhiSub	5	Perfect for gifting in Holiday season	Was really a great device although doesn't work without a wifi connection
3361	Kumar	5	Great product	The product is a great buy. Perfect one to use and get satiesfied
3362	00Del	5	Get one	Must have if you use Google Assistant or Google Home. Play a ton of content and control everything with your voice.
3363	CrazyC	4	Does The Job	Overall, good product for streaming to your TV. Only issue is doesn't work well on a public WI-FI. App can't seem to locate the device when you're ready to cast to it.
3364	Chevy	5	Love the Chrome	I love the ease of streaming right from my phone or computer.

3372	eric	4	Make your TV smart	If you want to make your HD TV a smart TV, this is the thing you need to do the job. It’s easy to install and navigate. However, the only downside is that you can only use it for certain softwares, and you can’t just project any website or app on the TV.
3373	Adriana	5	Works quite well for the price	Very high quality build, and simple to use. Best Buy shipped it fast and it was at my door within 5 days. Highly recommend if you want a “Smart” TV.
3374	Keisha	5	It's great for a newbie like myself.	The chromecast is very easy to setup. You're love it.
3375	KANNA	5	Good	The product is good and simple to use for a beginner.
3376	Consumer	4	good price	I bought it on Black Friday with $20. With this item, I can make my old TV become smarter. It works good with Youtube, but I am not statisfy when working with video from other websites. However, I'm still love it
3377	Richyg4	5	Easy set up	Setup was pretty easy. I haven’t yet learned all features. One I’m missing from Apple TV is that google is not turning on the tv and taking it to the hdmi port google is connected. I still need to look for the tv control for that
3378	Rich	5	Solid and reliable	Unless you are relatively new to the planet (and if you are, welcome to our planet) you've heard of streaming devices. This one is one of the simplest and easiest to install and use. Just plug it in and follow the onscreen prompts. This upgraded version features an extended connector for those tight fitting hdmi areas.
3379	Trisha	5	Can't imagine TV without it.	I love the flexibility of watching what I want to watch, when I want to watch it. I can effortlessly stream from my tablet, phone or pc - whatever is the most handy. I'm really enjoying having it linked to my Google Home and being able to control it with voice commands too

3382	Jarkore	5	Improved version.	I used to have the first chromecast and I realized this one works even better, it is faster and does not freezes sporadically as the old one. Since it does the stream itself you don't have to worry about draining your battery a lot.
3383	Hggh	5	Great product	It's great product and working perfectly with my TV.
3384	1248	5	Wonderful computer for the money	Computer is so easy to use and set up. It is really a great computer for the money.
3385	notmellinial	2	Too much Chrome	It takes a pro to use this without the Chrome focused income generation. Once I got the cast setting correct I could use this better with my laptop. Buy a smart TV with Wifi and Bluetooth to avoid these types of products.
3386	cuddylove	4	Serves a Purpose	Great little gadget for screen mirroring, especially from PC.
3387	Daniel	5	Excellent streaming device	It's an excellent device which avoid to use the tablet or notebook to watch netflix.

3399	rasaki1952	5	Fantastic Product	I have purchased seven of this item within the last 12 months. It makes it easy to connect to You tube to watch all kinds of movies from around the world and also listen to all genre of music. The last four I purchased are for my brother in Africa as a gift.
3400	Baygirl440	5	Great and you can move it	Great product and we can take it with us to College or on trips
3401	Nacho	5	Superb	Google chromecast gives you great features, besides, own tvs online features are not reliable. Chromecast is.

3403	MoJoe72	5	Great device.	Device connected easily and sinked with my phone with out a problem.
3404	Azmadman	4	Cheap device for streaming	Using to stream video from an Apple laptop and phone.
3405	Viva	5	Excellent Samsung Gallaxy S8 Plus Cell Phone	"The Samsung Gallaxy S8 Plus Cell Phone is easy to adapt to despite transitioning from using a Motorolla. I was expecting to be frustrated by a difficult learning curve but it is quite intuitive and the tutorials are helpful. The screen quality and camera are excellent. I chose the plus because I find larger screens are better for my vision. Also it has a blue light adjustment option. The speaker quality is also commendable. Since I was able to purchase it at a steep discount during the pre Black Friday sales the price was good.
Without that discount the regular price is high. However it does deliver value for cost and is priced in the same range as other phones with similar features and quality. It also came with very decent AKG earbuds included. The charger USB cord is easier to plug into the phone now because the metal connector is symetrical in the same way that adaptors for Apple products are. I am happy with my choice of this product."
3406	Ks6542	4	very easy to use the youtube	Having a chrome made it easy to use the you tube, but if you have a smart TV, I don't see a huge need of it, except to manually and easily control via your phone, which is a little annoying sometimes with youtube in a smart TV.
3407	Rep3	4	Great for watching on my TV	Quickly and easily sets up and makes it very easy to move things from my phone to my TV to watch.
3408	Anton	5	Nice	bought it as gifts for friends. really nice gift at good price!
3409	wifeypriolo	5	Great product from Google	Great product, saves me a lot of money because I just need to mirror my phone to my tv through the Chromecast and I'm able to watch my favorite programs just using my phone and internet,no more cable bills!
3410	Bjames92	1	Better options out there	I bought this on Black Friday and ended up returning it no remote had to use a app to control. Not user friendly.
3411	Anfomsc	4	Lots of uses	Works great to cast you tube for my baby boy it also works with Netflix and music
3412	Pyro5263	5	It's cool	I have only used it to hook to my Google home which was an easy set up. I tell Google to play Netflix and it does
3413	dave007	5	Chromecast	You can never go wrong owning a Chromecast. Highly recommended.
3414	DAddyV	5	It's from Google, of course it's good.	Come on, you don't have to ask. Works easily to cast movies from my phone to the tv.

3420	Beck	5	Love it	Great product at a good price. Can cast YouTube and Netflix from my iphone
3421	MikeyLowrey	5	Works perfect!	Product works perfectly! If you have a TV that doesn't have Chromecast built-in, this is a perfect way to stream almost any video content from your laptop via Chrome or phone via Chromecast app. It's also on sale for the holidays for $20 which is incredible

3449	AlterAmber	5	This is our 3rd	We had Amazon Fire for awhile and it was slow and lagging. Streaming shows would often pause and stop without warning. We've been using Chromecast exclusively for the past couple of years - rarely have trouble streaming (usually it's Netflix that logs us out but not Chromecast). We stream our favorite photos when we're not watching TV. Love being able to cast from phone or computer to TV seamlessly. Highly recommend.

3464	Annie	5	Cool way to make a dumb TV and Smart one	I wanted to screencast contents from my phone to my TV and this was my first option. I love how easy it is to setup and use.

3513	Latinoheat08rv	4	Great for the price	This product is good if you are testing the water with streaming devices. You can stream pretty much anything but it all comes from your phone. So every action you do you have to pick up your phone and browse what you want then stream it. Some people prefer a separate remote instead of always picking up the phone. You can use this with Google home to stream to your tv, but you have to know exactly what you want to do because there isn't a browsing menu on Chromecast. The price on this is great where you can pick up multiples for the home.

Well done!!

If you haven’t completely cut the final tip off your cord — it’s simple & quite minimal — YouTube TV, add chromecast devices as needed, enthrall yourself in unlimited DVR & share the love with others (6 per YouTube TV account).

3593	Mpatel	5	ChromeSuper	Love this ChromeCast. Easy to use take it with me when I travel to stream Netflix.
3594	Moev	4	Is good to have more features on your TV	But adding this you don't have to buy a new TV with the apps
3595	JMiami	5	Better than the original Chromecast	"It is a chromecast, you pick up a video or music from chrome on your laptop or from a compatible app in your phone and it is casted (streamed) directly to the device. It works just like the older version (and that is a good thing), but it also has a couple of differences:
- The HDMI connetor is separated from the main device through a flat and flexible ""cable"" that has a magnet on it. So, when you connect to your computer the main device is not pulling down the HDMI connector but instead it couples neatly to the back of the HDMI connector through the magnet. This is a major improvement as my last one was a single piece of plastic with an HDMI connector, and its own weight pulled down the connector until it finally broke. By making it more flexible it looks like it will last considerably more.

Other than this, it looks to be about the same. I cannot really perceive any differences. Now if you would like to compare it with other alternatives like the Amazon firestick, apple TV, or even ROKU, just take into account this question:

Do you want to turn your TV into a smart TV with its own apps, or do you want to improve the connectivity of your devices and the TV?

If you would like a smart TV consider the Firestick, Apple TV or Roku. If you would like connected devices take the Chromecast. Eitherway I'm sure you'll be happy."

3607	SDSD	5	Awesome product	"We were facing difficulties to cast our program from Ipad/iphone/Laptop to our big 55"" TV. It's best selection to replace HDMI cable. Now it's very very easy to cast our favorite programs to our big screen. I highly recommend this product to all."
3608	MasterCaster	5	Does exactly what it says	Very easy to set up (after I figured out my extension cord wasn't plugged in). Make casting from devices SIMPLE!!!

3616	Jonathanv	5	Lost my old chromecast	this improvement with the wire was a major bonus!!
3617	Sam007	4	Not very impressive	Purchased it to compliment Google home mini but very disappointed with the performance. Roku is much better product for similar price.

3619	Foof	5	Haven't Used this yet...	Purchased for a family member in another state and haven't had the opportunity to connect it yet - the 5 Star rating is because I have no reason to assume this product will not work with Google Home Mini.
3620	LUISMA	5	Excellent product to watch programs from cell.	I use this product to watch programs and transfer to the smart tv.
3621	Crisrianriosfernando1	5	Awesome	Have this connected to my Google home and works flawless
3622	Hollym	3	OK for the price	I did not realize that the only option is to stream from another device. For a little bit more money, I should have bought another Roku which is more user friendly.
3623	uzkerj	5	Chromecast	Easy to use. Takes 5 min to set up and turned my regular TV into a smart TV with a flawless connection
3624	Shank	5	Good product	works perfectly. you can cast anything on your tv with this chromecast.
3625	lowrider	4	Would give 5 stars if had a Nest cam app	Nice product, but what happened to the Nest product line integration? Google - you always strive for perfection, but what happened here?
3626	Marsh	5	Must have	This thing is so much better than a smart TV. I have one and still use this over it.
3627	samsung2014	4	Chromecast	Since my you tube app on my tv no longer work. Chromecast in #1 source can replace the app. My kid can even watch more than before. I like it.
3628	blg2612	5	Good product best service	Good product best service. nice design and has access to lot of streaming apps
3629	HeltonB	5	Its simply a great product	This product pays for itself. No complains! Download the google app and it just becomes so much easier to do anything !
3630	Ravi	5	Cast what you want	My idea is to cast my MacBook to tv, I don’t want to spend money on Apple TV, I bought chrome cast it not only cast what I want it also mirrors my Apple MacBook. I am happy for this price.
3631	Reddy	5	Great product	Its an awesome product for streaming and very nice price
3632	Eric	5	great to transmit to TV	I have the first generation Chromecast but decided to get the second generation as well. It works well and it supports 5 gigahertz as well

3637	Vartine2001	4	Product is great	I will definitely recommend this to anyone, it work just right
3638	rknboogie42	5	Awesome	Awesome for what we needed it for. Even though it has no remote, everyone can get the app on their phone to use the chromecast. You can cast your videos and still be able to watch videos on your phone or play games.
3639	JT03	5	Great	Got this on Black Friday, was using the 1st Gen and this is a much improved version. Quicker and much better design
3640	Mom2	4	Good for Hulu	We mainly use it for Hulu live and it works fine. Havent tried all the other features.
3641	Muffin	5	No more Charter	With me being able to stream movies from my phone to tv cuts down in the cable bill.
3642	alfred	5	My second one	This the second one I purchased. This small device is very convenient and the list of surporting app is large and continuing to grow.
3643	Doubleroll	5	Great add on	If you have google home, Nest etc this is a nice add on. I can stream my nest cameras on my TV. Easy to use and setup.
3644	BobF	5	Works as advertised.	I finally cut the cable. This was an easy set-up. I had Netflix and Hulu up and running within 15 minutes.(I already had a subscription.) I prefer watching movies and shows on my TV instead of the computer. I have to use my phone as the remote, which takes a little getting used to, but the adjustment period wasn't too painful. Everything now comes over my WiFi. I'm saving about a $100/yr over cable.
3645	Ajay	5	Great product!	Purchasing it the third time, this time for family since it’s a great product.
3646	Manny	5	Fun and time saver	It is always fun to load something on your phone and watch in the TV. Saves time on searching compare to other devices. This is my second one. May get more for other TVs.
3647	FrankieY18	4	Reliable and Stable	I've owned one before i bought this one. They are just so reliable when it comes to streaming videos from phone to TV. The only reason i couldn't give a 5-star rating because it needs to connect to a working Internet wifi to work.
3648	ZEN1TYM	5	Future Is Now	We're currently living in the future. (Don't try to argue with me on this one) To be able to share something from your phone to the big screen? AMAZING! Granted we still need the Chromecast to do it but hey, it's great.
3649	HVemula	4	Very good if you sync it with google home	When you link with Google home mini it works wonderfully.
3650	beaster54	5	works as advertised	this does the job i intended for it to do. if you are looking for one of these, look no further!
3651	Ivyp	5	Exactly what I was looking for	Great price for what I want. I just want to watch videos on some apps I have. Easy to install and easy to use.
3652	Brandon	5	Best streaming device	Works amazingly, even in poor internet connections.
3653	jimW	5	Needed a Google Chrome for TV watching	Good for the price. Just learning how to use it. So far, so good.
3654	r1814	4	Great for streaming	Great for streaming. HD quality picture and sound. Recommended.
3655	Mitul	5	Works well!	Compatible with all devices. Super fast connectivity!
3656	kjjung	5	as expected	works with any TV as long as you have HDMI and wifi.
3657	cpallavi93	3	Great device	Helps a lot. Is great for a non-smart TV, makes your tv smart.
3658	GM23	5	Simple and efficient	Chromecasts are an easy to use and widely supported by a raft of apps and services. I bought this for one of the one of its little-known functions - the ability to turn on/off the TV via a Google Home. Definitely worth setting up if you use Google Assistant and your TV supports it.
3659	tviscool1234	5	Nice Chromecast	Quick and easy to set up. Seems to have good antenna. I put it on a TV very far from my router and still picks it up and streams flawlessly. I'm very satisfied.
3660	negon12345	5	Great betters Thad my amazo tv	Going to buy more for Christmas go present. I love my chromecast
3661	lvmchief	5	Fabulous option for streaming media	I tried both the Chromecast and Fire TV, and I found the Chromecast to be much more versatile and consistent.
3662	Jenny	4	Just okay.	This device does what I.T should but I prefer my Roku over I.T.
3663	Brandino	5	Love controlling my TV via voice	Connects with Google Home and my phone easily. Love using it to watch videos, listen to music.
3664	Kritt	5	Great device!	This is my 2nd Chromecast, I need another one for my bedroom. This device work great with my new google home mini.
3665	Onearmedviking	5	Great product.	I have five of these now. I have one I travel with and on every tv
3666	GrandmaDianaB	4	You can't go wrong	Did exactly what I needed it for. Watching videos from my phone on the TV.
3667	dawn	5	love it	great and simple.. easy to use and cheap.. nice simple gift
3668	Arvea	4	Excellent for switch cell to tv	Excellent for switch cell to tv (Android or IPhone )
3669	swaroop	5	good	We really liked this item, which we brought during thanksgiving
3670	Olemiss78	5	Great	Love the Chromecast. I like to stream things on my tv
3671	gottclay	4	Works well, not expensive	Works as advertised. But, controlling the TV through a phone app is not all it's cracked up to be.
3672	Krish	4	Good prive	Great always with low price for the Black Friday sale
3673	Pankaj	5	Best chromecast	It is far better than old version and at $20 it is the best deal for perfect gift.
3674	mrtooj	5	Better than built in smart tvs	Works flawlessly, set up is not that bad but wished it had a quicker set up. Besides that it's great so far I have 3 and all my tvs are smart but this is just so much better works with iPhone and Android
3675	Kumar	5	Streaming super fast	I finally bought the chromecast though I have a smart TV. This casts super fast compare to loading apps from the TV's app store. Excellent and simple to use.
3676	Boogers	5	Chromecast is almost required for TVs today	A large portion of streamable content can connect to Chromecast and that's a big reason to get it. Incredibly convenient when you want to show something on your Android to everyone, like pictures you just took. Its easy to use and relatively affordable.
3677	BigPlum	5	Flawless	Works great, easy to hook up, easy to use. Installed at my parents house instead of getting them a Smart TV or Smart DVD player.
3678	DinoSahr	5	Chromecast	Bought it for my mom because she watches a lot of videos from YouTube and she really like the fact that she can now watch them on a bigger screen instead of on the phone
3679	jonny	5	Awesome	Product Works great! Best purchase for the price!!
3680	LuckyGuy	4	Love it!	Connects well with Google Home and mini. Great product!
3681	KPatel	5	Very good Product	Very good product if you do not have smart Tv than this product will make your Tv to be Smart.
3682	Phillipsche	5	It’s great	Would recommend HIGHLY !!! Anyone have any questions just comment :)
3683	Qtypyluv	5	so easy to instal	I was very excited about getting this on black Friday for a great price! its exactly what I wanted
3684	Javortiz147	4	My gateway Product was and still very useful	Chromecast got me into buying other google product specifically the Google mini and now I want to automate my whole home but Chromecast allows me to stream with my phone and google mini and turn off my tv for only $20 in fact I have 2 of them
3685	DonnaM	5	Convenient	Good price and convenient to have. We don't have cable and watch everything online. Easy to hook up, able to pair with android devices for mirror casting.
3686	ohiostatebucks	5	Great	The chromecast works great. Setting it up took only a few minutes. The only thing is I wished it had a dedicated remote and interface instead of everything needing your phone.
3687	Donald	5	Easy	Bought this on Black Friday. Great price and easy to set up
3688	Night	4	Worked Pefectly	I just bought two of these to have in the bed rooms to make it easy for the wife to stream video from her tablet.The Google Chromecast is relatively cheap, and will surely satisfy most, if not all of your needs and expectations, especially at the low price of $19.00
3689	Rick	3	Chromecast	It is not as easy to use as you might expect. IT took over the Netflix on my tv and now I cannot browse Netflix manually from my remote. That is very annoying. It works nice with the Goggle home with voice direction though.
3690	Niko	5	Easy to use	Simple and easy to use, works every time without any issues.
3691	KingGrone	5	For the price you can't complain	If you like to take it on the road , especially hotels , this is the item for yoh
3692	Bush	4	Amazing app	I just opens the box and plugged in with my TV and works perfect ...I recommend this product for those who don’t have smart TV
3693	Azkan	4	Love my chromecast	I was kinda surpised that it doesnt work with blutooth speaker without a transmitter.
3694	Claudia	5	Great item!	It works perfect with your google home! Hands free tv remote!
3695	Taylor	5	Easy to use!	I have a smart TV but I don’t like the apps on it. I got this as a suggestion from a friend and really love it! I am able to use my google Home Mini with this to turn on my tv and control what I am watching with my voice. Great supplement to any tv setup!
3696	rosieteach	5	Love my chromecast	The been amazing, it has allowed me to keep a great working TV and turn it into a smart TV is easily controlled by my phone. Even got my boyfriend to buy one for his house.
3697	PWRDByAdobo	4	Great budget Streamer	Works as intended. Though I wish they all had some apps built in already, can't beat $15 to stream to any tv with HDMI anywhere you can connect it
3698	sd3669	3	Can be a little slow at times	It works Ok but can be slow at times and not easy to navigate if you dont have good apps on your phone
3699	ohboyjeez	5	works great	i use it only to control google home. works fine for that feature.
3700	btan	5	Great product	Its very easy to use. Does what it’s supposed to do.
3701	Sanger	5	Awesome!	Turns your phone or tablet into a very handy device to search for what you want to watch on Netflix, Hulu, etc. Just need to make sure the app is castable.
3702	IGRMike	3	Still learning on how to use	Will need more time to learn all aspects of this item
3703	missgorgeous1kc	5	Replacement	I purchased this as a replacement. My old one stopped working. I've always loved the Google Chromecast product.
3704	Brian43	4	Good	It does exactly what you want. It allows you to connect your media to your computer.
3705	EGEGEG	5	Great	Got it to cast video from phone to TV/projector. Works great for TV, haven't tried it with projector yet, but it should work based on what I've done and seen so far.
3706	wiilpet	5	Excellent comfort and sound quality!	I would purchase this again and again. Great product.
3707	Nate	5	Its a good thing to have that little caster	I am very much happy to have it. its very convenient to have ur devices displayed with high quality on ur TV. but the sad thing is its only supported with goolge apps and some other only..
3708	NHCanuck	5	Perfect & easy to use	Just plug in, tie it on to your wifi, and it's ready to go! Using as a spare on our guest network for our guest bedroom.
3709	Alan	5	Simple and easy to use	Set up was very easy and quick to update. Works flawlessly with hulu and other streaming services.
3710	Rohan	5	Best cast device in market	I recommend to buy it . it's by far best product from google.
3711	Chuck	5	Works great	Just plugged it in and it was ready to go. Just needs to plug into your USB port on.
3712	Burge	5	Great	This is our second chromecast. It does what it should.
3713	TheDarkKnight460	4	better signal/connection at 5ghz	i had the first gen chromecast but had issues with connections and poor signal quality, so I upgraded to this newer version. the connection is better than before and it is able to use my 5ghz wifi band which increase the quality/signal a lot. i recommend upgrading, i got this over black friday for pretty good deal.
3714	snarkdiva	5	Works like a charm	I bought this Chromecast to replace an older version that one of my kids broke. The newer version is much more reliable. I get a good connection every time. I occasionally have issues casting certain tabs. Twitch, for example, is finicky, but that's a Twitch thing. It's great to be able to cast a tab to my TV while I'm doing something else on the computer. I only wish that there was a way to keep the audio portion on the computer rather than hearing it through the TV speakers since I use a Bluetooth headset with my computer. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and convinced my dad to get one.
3715	epic	4	Make a dumb TV smart	Still wish they expanded out features on these, but they are still game changers for older TVs.
3716	Uleepera	3	Love it with one exception	Since Google and Amazon are having a tiff you can't use Amazon prime on this. Get a roku instead since they are a 3rd party and support all platforms.
3717	Ross	5	Great	I love my chromecast. it’s great for watching sports or playing music!
3718	Kokies	5	Perfect and affordable price	Perfect, small size, and affordable price. I really like it
3719	Rolo	5	Black Friday Purchase	If i were to pay $35 for this, it'd be 4 stars, but for $20 This is an extremely good casting device to buy. Sure you have roku players or the amazon fire stick, but simply wanting to watch something on your phone to the big screen couldn't be simpler and fast.
3720	LikesGames	5	Easy to set up and use	If you want to watch something on your tv instead of your phone or computer, this is the easiest way to do so. No more plugging and unplugging cables that may or may not be compatible with your devices. Just connect to Wi-Fi and click the cast button from your computer or phone.
3721	Pisces	5	Easy to use	The chromecast was easy to install on my television. There were so many sites on the web that I was able to enjoy.
3722	Bobitos123	5	Great gadget for streaming	Works perfectly. Just hit the button and it all goes to the tv.
3723	Viewer	5	Best Option for streaming movies.	This allows very easy access to streaming content on-line when your television does not have a built-in version.
3724	Shante	5	LOVE MY CHROMECAST	Excellent product. Easy to use. I have three in my house!
3725	Lucifer	4	Great Streaming devices	Easy to setup and use, You can add a huge playlist on youtube and let it play
3726	tonygd1283	4	Love it	Works great and easy to connect to my wifi. Easy to use as well.
3727	sakim	4	decent	Wanted to cast my phone onto the tv. works as expected. easy set up.
3728	Keef	4	Works great	Bought this for my grandparents and they loved the option to be able to get apps on the tv
3729	Tigger	4	Wireless use of computer to TV	Allows me to TV screen for image and sound as my display for computer and smartphone. Wirelessly.
3730	Lance	4	I wish it was 4K capable	I wish it was UHD 4K capable, other wise it just do the same thing as my XBOX or PS4 can do along with my Android smart phone. Not much advantage that make me wants to keep this product.
3731	Kafei	1	Low quality	First off, this is not a standalone streaming device. You need to select the content you want to cast from your phone. Second, screen mirroring from Android tablets is horrendous. Nothing like the quality of Apple TV. Will not work well in an educational setting.
3732	BestbuyCustomer	4	Good one	"It's good device but price are costly.

Recommand to buy on sale"
3733	Tyler	4	Good	Meet my expectations. Machine works well. I was looking for something economical and also good performance. This meet both expectations
3734	Jewels	4	Works great	We love the chrome cast. My son can watch all his shows in his room now.
3735	geeky	4	small, connect easily	The device is small plugs into hdmi port on tv or receiver. Great onscreen directions on how to use
3736	Olaaa	4	Very good	The product has worked quite well so far. There has been no complaints from friends and family about its use.
3737	jsto60	4	Chromecast	This newer version works better than the older generation
3738	Sara	4	Chromecast	Absolutely love it! I’m able to stream a variety of shows
3739	Sifath	3	You can stream things from your phone to your tv	This product allows you in a way to convert your non-smart tv into a smart tv. You can stream a variety of apps such as Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, and even Google Photos but I would prefer to be able to mirror everything from my iPhone to my tv. None the less this is a nice product and I find it useful
3740	Gardner8014	4	Great	Works great for a low price easy to hook up and use.
3741	DaFish	4	Handy Dandy	I take this with me for my older friends whose kids have gotten them a new, bigger screen TV, that is HDMI ready. My phone has a big screen, for a phone, but not big enough for vision-impaired folks. I can set up the Chromecast, and show them on their big screen YouTube videos & all kinds of stuff off my phone! No more worrying about their pushing those pesky phone buttons or the touchy touchscreen! Some fun!
3742	Sdlee1410	4	Great for streaming	Really like streaming things onto my TV. Easy to use and easy to setup.
3743	Luvit	4	Love this little chromcast	So easy to hook up plays just like it says it does. Will probably get more for my other TVs.
3744	Nocomeback	4	Less user friendly	Must use your phone to operate it, but overall it's a great device to use if you don't have smart tv features.
3745	mark1980	4	good product	I like the product, but it needs to some improvements such as a power switch to turn on and off the device.
3746	Amitnis	4	Chromcast review	Very good, cost effective streamer. Minimum functionality but good value for money.
3747	Nzplatt	4	Works well	Works like you would expect simple. Wish it had hdmi I put too so you didn’t have to change the tvbinput
3748	GODzillaPMOR	4	Easy casting straight from my phone	"The chrome cast uses your phone as the ""remote"". Cast anything from your phone with the ""cast"" button straight to your tv. Easy to use and it works with Google home on certain apps."
3749	Vjs13	4	Quick and easy	Website was easy to access. Reviews helped me make my decision.
3750	Jaybird99	3	No physical remote	It works and gets the job done. Although not having a dedicated remote makes things a little inconvenient.
3751	Utvolfan67	5	Simple and easy setup	Does exactly what you expect. Can cast many things to my tv now. From my computer and phone with ease. Setup is 5 min tops
3752	Aaron912	4	It works good	It’s ok but half the stuff I wanted to use it for it wouldn’t do, but that was on me for not reading into it more before I bought it
3753	DrMike	4	Pretty Good	This is the second one that I've bought over the past couple of years. This is the newer version and is much easier to plug in the TV. Occasionally it stops the casting, but that may be due to the source of the programming. Overall it's pretty good.
3754	OBIWANJABRONI	3	Kind of unimpressive	Tried this, then a Fire Stick. Ended up getting a Roku Premiere Plus for $50 from Best Buy. If you can find a similar deal, it’s definitely worth the extra money. Really didn’t think much of the Chromecast.
3755	denniscn	4	Good to keep wife busy	I love his item because instead of my wife asking me a million questions I can't answer now she just asks Google
3756	Shorty	3	Did what it was supposed to	Good worked right out of the box no problems installed the app easily.
3757	DRDAN25	4	Does not work with every tablet	"Beware. Will not work with some tablets for doing the ""chrome casting"" option. Some of the 8"" tablets from major manufacturers time out with this device. Overall, a good device for chrome casting from a laptop or desktop PC. It does work with Gen2 Lenovo 8"" tablet and Amazon 8"" tablet for chromecasting."
3758	3x41	3	Works as intended.	It works as intended. It works much better with devices other then Apple Products.
3759	jeannea	4	Handy	I got this mainly to view videos I have downloaded to my computer, but so far I haven't figured out how to broadcast this way other than projecting my desktop which isn't the best option because the volume comes out of the PC as well as the TV - very annoying. It does work well with apps like You Tube, etc. And my son says his Google Mini works with it sometimes but not for everything he would like it to do. So it's still a work in progress.
3760	Td123	4	Great for music	Use this to play music on my stereo outside. Great to be able to use my smart phone to control the music
3761	SheepPoppa	4	Great Cable Cutter	ChromeCast has provided the best method to watch content the viewer chooses, not what is provided by cable or satellite. Your television can now easily and wirelessly feature video, photos, YouTube, or other online content from your computer or smart phone. To view movies or television shows stored on your computer, I recommend the VideoStream app.
3762	Vishwas	4	Good but remote missing	missing voice command system which Amazon's device excels with
3763	CRH84	4	Great for watching TV	User friendly and easy to connect to. Linked my phone to it in minutes and was ready to watch TV.
3764	Lara	4	Very good product	Easy to setup and use, works perfect most times! I use it all the time and have no complaints
3765	Arhendrix11	5	Great for our extra bedroom	We decided to cut cable so we didn’t have the option of watching tv in our bedroom anymore. Then we decided to go with the Chromecast. It’s been great for our bedroom TV and just enough for what we need in there.
3766	Dukej48	5	Casting	Works well, strong connection to my WI-FI. Don't have any issues casting contents.
3767	Tucnrol124	4	Great little smart device	No other device allows me to cast from my phone to my TV except Chromecast. I love it and for myself who's not very technical savy it is very easy to set up and use.
3768	Ragent26	5	Easy to set up, easy to use	This was actually the third Chromecast that I've bought, loved it since the first one and still do. The added benefit of getting to control it with my voice (through my Google Home Mini) is definitely a huge plus, and was super simple to set up with the Google Home app (which I use to set up my Chromecasts anyway).
3769	MGMG	5	Awesome!	Awesome for projecting my chrome book on a television!!
3770	Kevin	5	Best way to get smartphone content onto tv	This is the best way to get smartphone content onto tv. Simple to use and set up.
3771	fastlane2010	5	Great product	Love this have 2 of them one for the house and one for work
3772	Nile	5	Great product	it was a seamless experience to set it up and this is a great product
3773	oneTes	4	It does well.	My purchase of the Comcast was intended to go with my google home device. It turned out that I really didn't understand the chrome cast.
3774	Bialaro	5	Great Product	Highly recommended this product as a Christmas gift.
3775	Pablo	5	Works just perfectly!	This is a great device. Everything runs smoothly on it. It is easy to set up and connect to any TV. I totally recommend it!
3776	bestbri	5	So easy	The apps I wanted aren't available on my smart tv. Chromecast was so easy to install and use. Now anything I can get on my phone, I can get on the tv.
3777	AXXX	5	Very handy	The most user friendly streaming device for a very reasonable price.
3778	Marie	5	Great Gizmo	I've been through using the Roku and Amazon Fire and prefer this device because it has all the other options but also allows you to send YouTube TV video to your TV from your phone.
3779	Suchee	4	Best for casting	The Chromecast is a good buy for anyone looking to cast movies/videos or any type of device onto their TV. My wife and I love that our options from mobile to TV are almost endless.
3780	Nymeria	5	great product	great product and very easy to use. comes in handy for streaming services in any tv
3781	Aggie2021	4	Great Product for Chrome Mirroring	Love this product! We use it at work to mirror one of our chrome tabs while leaving the other's private.
3782	Bowlman2330	5	Best bang for the buck!	Chrome cast is awesome. Can cast pretty much anything from an Android device and a lot from an iPhone. One of the best values out there.
3783	NancyC21	5	A MUST TO have	I bought 5 of this product.Great for casting. Also a good item to give as gift.
3784	Facetoface	4	Lost Connection!	I bought this product for my dad and it was easy for him to set up. The connection was fine but sometimes undetectable or confused with other devices in house.
3785	Stosh	5	better then gen 1	"I love chromecast. My first gen device was working fine but I wanted to see if Google would give me any addtional incentives for buying another device - nope, at least not yet.
It does start my video streams just a tad faster then the older device which is a plus but nothing too exciting. Still, great and if you grab it on sale at $30 you're gonna love it"
3786	Charles	5	Nice streaming devices	It’s nice for streaming videos. And, it can also play photo albums on TV
3787	Bklyndragon	3	Not wat I expected	Not bad but not good either. Is glitchy at times. My Samsung tab s3 only connects via apps. Although my galaxy s8 connects with no problem. Etc etc etc
3788	MinKarBryant41	5	The Chromcast was Better.	The Chromcast was better than I thought it was going to be. It resembles the Firestick, however, it’s better as gas as the app center. The Google Chromcast is just better.
3789	Mlewis	5	I like my chromecast	The chromecast is the beast shop I do. My son loved
3790	Denise	5	Easy as pie	I can now watch netflix and you tube on my TV without using data from my inernet provider. Awesome.
3791	Blake	5	A Favorite	I love the Chromecast! It's very easy to set up and use. I also like that it allows you to cast your browser as well.
3792	Missjo	5	Great invention	We really enjoy this product and it is so versatile. Really enjoy that we can use our smartphone to control it.
3793	Yoly	5	A gift	I bought this as a gift for my son, he says that he is very pleased with the functionality of the product.
3794	Cris	3	Interesting	After getting it set up the 1st time was able to watch on it. The next days I have to disconnect and reconnect before I can watch anything.
3795	Diana	4	Good product and siple to use	I got my first chromecast 3 yrs ago and still works fine! so we got a second for my father, he learned how to use it in a blink
3796	Chili	5	Chrome cast 2	Works fine out of the box, took a little bit to set up, but it was not painful.
3797	Nikki	5	Perfect Hubby Gift!	I bought this chromecast as a Christmas gift for my husband and he really likes it! Uses it often. Definitely worth it to buy!
3798	electronicslove	5	great chromcast	I used it for HDTV but do not have you tube access.
3799	Jims	3	Lov it	I recommand the chromecast I don't use it that often because it doesn't have a remote however I do recommended I enjoy watching old shows such as Green Acres in my 3 sons that otherwise might not be able to
3800	Es22	5	Great	Had it for awhile already, still working. It works with so many programs it’s great.
3801	joaquindbt	5	Great Device for Streaming	I had an old version of a chromecast and decided to buy this new one when I was moving to leave the other one to my mom. It has a more stable connection than the older one I have and it looks nicer.
3802	Bebe0710	5	Very useful	Works great getting additional channels at the TV get more fun and diversity
3803	HypoCriticalJew	4	Great as secondary resource or traveling	"We bought this when it was on sale and for the price it was worth it. We currently have a smart tv, but this makes it easier to browse apps such as CW or other prime time channels that it doesn't offer on it. The only downside with this version compared to the previous one is the odd times it will lose connection to the phone in the middle of programming. If we need to pause or rewind during a movie or show from app it'll often end up requiring us to completely restart the app or reset the connection..

When not used at home it is an incredibly easy way to watch movies or shows when traveling and staying at a hotel. As it packs comfortably in my suitcase or backpack. As every hotel has a hd tv it is a simple matter of connecting it to the wifi on my phone and popping it onto a free hdmi port on the back."
3804	Oldface81	5	Get It	Great to have for trips and TV's with no cable, even TV's with cable when you want to watch those downloaded movies.
3805	Jeremy	5	A great way to share	With the Google Chromecast, you can share a lot of different things from YouTube or Facebook or anything. I've used this for sharing websites, for sharing funny videos, you can use it for a lot of different things. One of my favorite options is the screen saver that makes your TV wall art.
3806	sevenREDseven	5	Stocking stuffer	I bought 3x more of these as stocking stuffers and spares. Def recommended!
3807	gamom	5	works great!	Had to buy to make a cut the cord service easier. Been using it for 2 months; works great!
3808	MMF382	5	Love this!	Works like a charm with minimal setup. Great for streaming apps or having a bigger monitor for web browsing.

3810	mcollierforduke	5	Excellent item!!	I purchased this so we didn't have to have wires hooked up from our phones/tablets to watch stuff on TV. It works great!! Watched a basketball game from my phone on it the other night, because it was not on TV. Love it!!
3811	4545	5	Great way to view YouTube	Bought to replace a first edition Goole and it was worth it. Takes advantage of my upgraded TV's increased screen capabilities.

3814	Jumper	3	Works fine, but . . .	You can only cast programs from castable apps on your cell phone. Comcast live TV stream cannot be cast!

3816	Rfox	4	Good option for tv	My daughter really loves this product and the ability to watch things on her large screen tv from the phone

3819	TechieDad	5	Easy to use.	Plugged it in, waited on the update and ready to go.
3820	Smeat	4	Best thing ever, but can be annoying	"Love the functionality and existence of this device. Don't know how I lived without it all these years. Streaming from basically any device on your home network and controlling it from your phone, basically all apps work with it... It is my go to media player these days.

That said it occasionally can't be found, or doesn't load, or keeps playing while your phone or other device has lost it. Can be very annoying because as of today I still haven't figured out if it's the Chromecast or my phone or my network that is to blame. Doesn't help diagnostics when you cannot reliably duplicate the results."
3821	BestBuyShopper	5	Changes tv watching	More and more streaming and news apps have chromecasting available. It works flawlessly. I can switch between Netflix, you tube, Reuters, nbc, hbo, etc, and even cast my own photos and videos to the tv. Works with any of my devices and can be setup to work with guests.

3879	KMH1313	5	Maximize your HDTV experience	"This is one of my favorite tech purchases that I have ever made! I use my 55"" HDTV for so much more than just watching TV thanks to my Google - Chromecast. Having just returned from a cruise the week that I made my Chromecast purchase I was able to broadcast all of my pictures and videos on a 55"" HDTV and show them to my friends and family rather than show them on my 6"" phone screen. Installation was a breeze even for a non-tech savvy guy like me! Plug it in to your TV and download an app to your smartphone to broadcast. It's that simple."

3900	dudejoeownsyou	4	Excellent for Youtube tv	If all you do is YouTube or have YouTube Red and TV, this is great. And if you’re a cord cutter, its a no brainer to get it. It’s pretty much a casting device, and all the apps would be on your smartphone or tablet.

3911	K1234	4	Great for streaming videos	My husband bought this and he loves it. We watch videos from his phone all the time and it's nice that it's wireless. At sometime it tough to connect but I think he was just doing it wrong I've never had that problem.
3912	Apy23	3	Might retry	Bought this first to try streaming TV, constantly going out, returned it and bought a Roku and it worked great. Might try this again down the road because the price was so good, but it did not stream well.

3921	Woodsbuggy3	5	These are great.	Not quite as convenient as a fire stick but they do the job and for the most part. Every now and then phone looses connectivity with it while playing something and requires you to play around some to get working again but overall its a nice little gadget.

3931	Gazelle	5	Best thing ever	Pretty much everyone I know has one including myself so yeah they're pretty awesome
3932	Justin	5	Simply the easiest way to watch content	I really enjoyed this device to mirror my screen to the big screen.
3933	Loscar	4	Good product, may use some speed	A very good product, it could use a bit more speed though
3934	Rickee	5	Google Chromecast is an awesome device!	"Google hit the mark with Chromecast. It is great being able to put content from my phone / iPad to the TV. It works extremely well with the mobile app as well. I love that I'm able to cast content full screen and then use my phone or iPad while the content is still playing.

The one drawback (which isn't Google's fault) is that some apps don't support Chromecast. I'm not sure why, but this means you're unable to display the video content from these apps on the TV.

In the office, we're able to use Chromecast quite reliably to project computer content during meetings.

Overall, a fantastic device. It is definitely a 5-star rating, especially considering the low price point."
3935	blink	5	MY SISTER LOVES IT	GOT IT FOR MY SISTER SHE IS NO GEEK BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO GET IT UP AND RUNNING ON HER OWN AND SHE LOVES IT.
3936	MTTodd	5	Excellent	Works well with android and iPad. Quick setup. Easy screen cast
3937	Deyus	4	Great product with an odd flaw.	I got the new version of the chromecast because anytime I used YouTube TV there was long pause and message that said my Chromecast was first gen and might have long delays when watching live programming. That doesn't happen with the new one but I do constantly lose connection to the Chromecast and have to rest out to reconnect.
3938	Salvarez	4	Easy to use	Easy to use, easy to assemble. Great product, I love it!
3939	Teaster	5	A Must Have!!	It makes things easier when everything in life is on the cell phone, with this you can show it on the tv.
3940	DJFAITH	5	Chromecast	This is a great buy, I have purchased about 3 of them one for each television.
3941	j2ndine	3	Meh...	Don't waste your money. Get Amazon Fire or a bluray player with a lot of apps.
3942	Nicanor	5	Great if you have an Android	Doesn’t work real well with IPhone and what we actually wanted it for. Ended up taking it back after a few days, but our friends Android work awesome with it.
3943	DBC25	4	Does what is says it will do	It is great at going with what the Google Home tells it to do and mirrors a ChromeBook perfectly.
3944	Suresh	4	Great product	Working good, but once in a month disconnect on it's own..
3945	Kostay	5	Works great	Works just like all previous gen products. No issues at all

3948	Mike	4	Love it	This is my third one. I have them on all my TVs. I also use AppleTV, which I may like a little bit better, but this works with Google Home which is fantastic. I love controlling the TV with my voice.
3949	Kimmy	3	I can't talk on my phone while watching a show	Unable to talk and use Chromecast at the same time
3950	mj123	5	Awesome	Good to have if you want to watch youtube on tv and you don't have a smart tv
3951	Rick	5	Google Cheomecast	Works like a charm. Quality product and good service from best buy
3952	SupaCu	5	Great way to stream movies	I was an Apple TV user for 3yrs now. I wanted to get a 2nd one for the basement, but the new Apple TV was $179. The chromecast was just $35 and this little beast does everything the Apple TV do at a fraction of the cost. Only downside is you need a smartphone or computer to stream to the device....
3953	Luci	5	Great product	Works great. Enjoy being able to cast from my phone to the tv. Initial set up was easy.
3954	MIchaeljack	5	great product	Extremely user friendly and convienant to use in my home

3957	Ickesman	4	Works good	Has more options then just the smart tv has. Easy to use
3958	Bleek	4	Love	Love the new version of the chrome cast. Fast and easy to setup.
3959	Jane	5	Excellent	Having never tried streaming or the use of a device to assist in this process, I found this product easy to use and a great enhancement to my viewing experience.
3960	Dave	5	Purchased to watch mobile only content on TV	I subscribe to streaming content that is only available on the web or mobile device. There is not currently an app for Roku or Amazon TV. This device solved this problem.
3961	chinnman	5	Does the Job	Great for streaming programs to your TV by using your smart device as the remote. This may not be for everyone. But if you’re the type where want to control everything with less hardware, then this is for you!
3962	None	5	good quality	Perfect for watch netflix movies and videos. Good quality
3963	Dbyford	5	Perfect for travel	I use this Chromecast while traveling. Works great in hotels when wanting to watch my subscribed content.
3964	Chubs	5	Great Buy	Great quality. Easy to install and instructions were precise.
3965	RuRu	5	Easy to use	I’m so glad i have this now because i can watch movies whenever and wherever i am. It is very handy.
3966	Dante	5	Great device	Better than the first generation and same quality and service
3967	Lscook	5	Excellent	This little tool comes in quite handy when you want to project your screen onto a tv.
3968	CG101	5	"Know the difference between ""Cast"" and ""Mirror"""	"So, I bought this so that I can watch movies from my phone...it took a while for ""Google Home"" to get its act right, but I am finally able to do so. I have two non-4K TVs, so these models are perfect! I bought two and setup was easy enough. I have to ""Mirror"" my phone to watch local contact. Mirroring you can't use your phone for anything else. However, when you ""Cast"", you can use your phone in the background while the app is ""Casting."" We no longer hook up our phones to a HDMI/MHL cable to view content on our phone. Highly recommend."
3969	ciero24	4	Really cool product	This is a great product that connects with your mobile device, it took a couple of tries to sync with my phone which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 but once it does it works great. what a great way to share pics and videos from a mobile device to a big screen, highly recommend this product
3970	Robin	4	Bought it for my son. He loves it	Great product. I recommend it for stocking stuffers.
3971	JKLowell	5	Changed my TV watching experience	"While I already have access to YouTube, VRV, and Netflix on other devices, I love watching through my Chromecast connected through my Google Home. Just being able to say, ""Ok Google, play Bojack Horseman"" and immediately start binging is worth the price of admission. It has also made it easier to show silly YouTube videos on my phone to everyone in the room."
3972	SUrrey	3	Great birthday gift for a grandchild	Was a birthday gift for the granddaughter. Said she likes it a lot
3973	Busymom2	5	Easy to install	Easy and fast to enstall and enjoy. My kids love it too because they can cast their favorite shows on TV
3974	dahnb2000	4	Works great with Android	Not much to say. Plugin, setup, it works. Simple to use.
3975	Ivonne	3	Good	Its good but the screen casting is very laggy.Overall rating 3 stars.
3976	ethinkg	4	Nifty media device	Chromcast seems to work best with android rather than iOS. It is cool to have the ability to cast to different rooms/TVs on your network. Truly makes your TV/media center “smart”
3977	Entense	5	Great	The only reason why I got this was to cast YouTube TV and it works great!
3978	ACME	4	Chromecast	Love streaming online content to my TV! Stream video, browser, or entire screen.
3979	Nicole	4	Little difficult	It was a little frustrating for set up, but my nephew got it working for me with no problem! Thanks
3980	Great759	5	Awesome	"Great piece of hardware!
We use it all the time and it works great!"
3981	babe	5	Great product	Device works very well. Easy to set up and use. Excellent.
3982	Chad	4	Works perfect	I purchased this to stream sports programming that wasn't being broadcast in my region. Perfect solution.
3983	Nightmare00	5	Simple and Easy to Use	If you're looking to cut cable, this device will definitely assist in the easiest way possible. It is also quite small and hides behind my TV which is a great bonus.
3984	Jess	5	Awesome Streaming Device	Best streaming device I have used. We wanted to stream a football game taking place in a foreign country and could only use our iPhone app to stream. This helped our whole family and friends watch the game together on our television!
3985	Pradeep	5	Excellent	Bought this one to gift it to my parents and they are just loving this addition to their smart tv.
3986	Hoov	5	great product	We needed a device to mirror our andriod phone to our tv and our firestick never worked very well connecting. The chromecast has been perfect for our need
3987	Laptop	5	Very useful for old tv's to cast from phone/laptop	Made work easy and portable by substituting HDMI cable. Easy to cast anything from phone and Laptop on the screen
3988	Kmont805	5	Great product	Easy install plug and play better than ruku in my opinion
3989	Buzz	5	Great Picture Quality	Looks good for not being the 4K one. I have 3 in the house now all using a 5G wifi network. Great picture!
3990	jay5	5	amazing device	really allows use of all your favorite devices and apps together music vidioes etc
3991	Rody	4	Not too bad	Working great with my tv without any problems...good quality
3992	Scottg	5	Great Product	Very easy to set up and use and for the cost you can't beat it. Great Picture with very little buffering.
3993	BuyTheBest	5	Love the streaming ability and speed	I get great streaming videos and not a lot of buffering (as before). I recommend this over the other streaming devices I have tried. Great product
3994	fuentesjd	4	Great product for a cheap solution	"This product is really cheap and it works. You still will need a phone and tablet to connect to it, but it does the job, and you can't really complaint for the price. overall, I would recommend it if you're looking for a cheap solution to making your tv a ""smart tv""."
3995	alchen	5	great	This product does exactly what it is advertised to do. It is VERY easy to set up and get operational. If you are cutting the cable, this is something you really should try. Of course when you get something that is nice, you think of ways to improve it. It would be sweet to be able to project any window or the entire desktop if on a PC to the TV but Windows ans Apple will probably never let others in. I have tried the Google Chromecast from my family room TV using an iPhone, Windows 10 PC and MAC. All work the same way and equally enjoyed. I will be getting 2 more for other areas in the house. I defiantly recommend this item.
3996	Terry	5	Google chromecast	My husband really wanted to watch Game of Thrones. This made it possible. Easy to use.
3997	CMA06	5	Great tool to project movies on TV	"Bought this to project movies on YouTube from laptop/ cell to TV. 
Works great-easy setup !"
3998	Edawg	4	Hehe	This is a google little device if you own android anything. Great to caste etc.
3999	Oregon177	4	Good Product Not As Easy To Use As A Fire Stick, E	Great product. Easy to use. But it should be noted that you must leave whatever u cast actively on your device you are casting from in order for it to stay streaming.
4000	Eddie	5	Awesome	Awesome Gadget hooks up any device quick and easy love this
4001	SpoDad	4	Spoaknedad	Works really great for YouTube and Netflix. To bad it won't work with all videos overall very happy with it.
4002	bd17	5	A step up from the previous generation	"Went in looking for the Chromecast Ultra, but settled on this one.
Connectivity and functionality is a snap."
4003	Aimology	5	Legit	"I stream from my iphone and my laptop perfect. You just plug it into your TV USB and the power HDMI etc etc. Connect to WiFi from your phone with bluetooth ( the cast comes on when you turn TV on after you plug it in ) 

After that use google chrome from your laptop or download chrome from Iphone and through Chrome you click share and it will mirror whatever is in your browser. I'm sure some things like youtube or maybe app's also come with it, but I dont use those. I just use chrome and click share in the upper right hand corner.

Streams my tv shows and phone no issues ever."
4004	baliscott	5	Perfect for what I wanted!	I have a 47' LG 3D smart TV that is now just old enough that apps like YouTube are no longer supported. We also keep our tv in the basement where the wi-fi signal is a little weak. Watching Netflix was a hit-or-miss affair. Thanks to Google Chromecast and its wi-fi antenna, Netflix streams flawlessly. We also can watch YouTube videos again! Excellent value for the price.
4005	tome	3	Google	"I had purchased this device to go along with my Google Home.
After hooking this Comcast I then realized I had no idea what I was doing."
4006	rdvtx	5	Great product, work well with no issues.	It was easy easy to set up, no issues so far and the price is good.
4007	Vijay	5	Great Casting product	This is a excellent video casting product. I am enjoying the product.
4008	Cebishop	4	Easy to use!	No extra equipment to buy, plug and play nice and easy.
4009	preacherboy34	5	Great for church use.	I bought this for our church to use on the different TV's. We use it to show announcements and different videos in the rooms. Easy to use and easy to train people what to do.
4010	Fercho	5	Great device	Great streaming device which allows you to have access to several apps from your phone.
4011	Jordan	5	Nice unit!	This is a very nice unit! Easy connectivity easy configuration!
4012	Sledder	5	Does what it’s supposed to	Breath of fresh air for our plasma tv in the basement.
4013	SkyJ	4	Different than expected but great!	Awesome product, a little different that what I was expecting, but a phenomenal buy!
4014	NurseT	4	Great product	I love the fact you can use your phone to watch apps on your tv
4015	Gamer	5	Very Good Streaming Device	The google chromecast is a very good streaming device. This revised version is much faster than the first generation and allows you to watch pretty much every single app possible.
4016	Princesj39	5	Great Device!	So far so good! I've always had a chromecast to stream youtube and to rent movies on the playstore and when I got a new tv I decided to get a new chromecast. This one is very nice, works faster even with my Galaxy S5! The picture is great and it quickly connects to the internet, I don't use hulu or netflix but I have in the past so I cannot comment on how those stream. This is a good streaming device for mobile to tv!
4017	spice	4	good	You can get all the apps you need with this. I will buy again.
4018	Happy	5	Wonderful gizmo	This little tool allows me to watch videos on my TV with 2 clicks. Easy to set up and so great not to have a cable running across the living room floor. I can leave the computer in the office and not have to have it close to the TV. It transfers a better picture than when I was using the cable with my computer. I have an HP Chromebook and I love them both.
4019	DDPT	5	Great streaming device......!	This is an awesome little streamer I stream all kinds of content to my portable monitor like pandora,netflix,hulu,slingtv etc
4020	Alex	5	Super convenient	So easy to instantly connect to. Works great. I use it everyday
4021	jskillian	5	Fling It!	Great for throwing video from your phone to your big screen!
4022	Nuse	5	Good	Exactly what it claims to be. We are happy with this.
4023	ChrisW	4	It work better than expected	Very satisfied with purchase would recommend to a family member
4024	kookbit	4	Good Product	Easy to install and good useage in multiple rooms when moved
4025	J2010T	4	Great device	I had an older original version of the chrome cast but the new ones are great. Same functions but better response speed partly bc the 5g wifi
4026	Katy	5	Love it!	Easy and convient. Can You Tube, stream and save money on no cable bill. Dont have to have a smart tv to use!
4027	Jeff	5	We love Chromecast	This is our 3rd one. Got one on each TV. It's really easy to use.
4028	KKay	5	Great device	This device gives me great viewing ability for the shows I like to watch.
4029	robby999	4	Works As Advertised	Very simple to setup and use. Very good picture quality thanks to the HDMI connection.
4030	Carlosluis	5	Perfect for my presentations	Google chromecast is the best device to make work presentations mirroring my laptop or my cellphone in a big screen.
4031	mdtapia	5	Chromecast	it's a Chromecast, need I say more? steam just about anything from any Android device or chrome enabled laptop
4032	LuckyKate	5	Chromecast	Bought one while back. Then bought one for my bf and love the new style..
4033	granny	5	Great product for the price	Good item would tell my friends about it. That is all.
4034	Dominic	5	Really Neat	Neat gadget. Connect your phone to your TV with this. Really cool.
4035	Country	5	Easy everything	Easy set-up and easy to use. And I like how it has a very small footprint and takes up very little space.
4036	Olyvia	5	Chrome	I got this product for my boyfriend house we do not do a lot of tv watching there we are on the go a lot. But it is great for new movies through our phone and good local channels alsoz
4037	Sandie	5	Great for streaming	This product was easy to use and worked perfectly. Tech support was excellent when I contacted them to ask a question.
4038	dogwalker	5	A great Chromecast for working on tv	I love the way it works on my tv! It helps to use on pulling in apps because I don't have a smart tv. It makes.my tv a smart tv.
4039	Kiki	5	Great for teenager	Purchased for a 17 year old. He had no problem using it and loves it for the tv in his room.
4040	GFDRI	5	Inexspensive, easy to use/setup	Wanted to get MLB at Bat off the computer and onto the TV. Chromecast was the least expensive way. Casting is simple from phone or computer. Also when I’ve streamed movies I love not being forced to watch on the computer. You do need wireless internet and a hdmi port for it to work. It’s frills free compared to other options but works great and is easy to set up.
4041	StPeetr	3	Good but won't cast Amazon Prime Video	Fairly satisfied but two improvements needed. Wanted to use for casting slide/video presentations at remote sites. Won't w/o WiFi internet access - have to set up wifi hotspot w/ cellphone to get it to work - needs a Miracast like option to allow direct casting from lap top/tablet/smartphone! Also won't cast Amazon Prime Video.
4042	Trekker	5	Great product!	Makes it simple to brodcast from any Android mobile device to screen. Takes minutes to set up and go.
4043	Berddman	4	Easy set up.	Chromecast was is to set up. Works great with youtube tv.
4044	Humanzee	4	Does the job; dependence on other device a hassle	"Cheap, works well most of the time, has some neat features, but at the end of the day it's got no remote or interface of its own; it's entirely dependent on your phone or tablet to operate. It sounded ok in principle, but in practice it's kindof annoying, and occasionally flaky, since it's dependent on a weird daisy-chain of apps/devices/connections to work.

I ended up getting one of those new rokus later, and use it far more often, so far without the slightest hiccup. There's a handful of things the chromecast can do that it can't, so I find value in both, but overall the Roku is the better product, for not too much more money."
4045	PsalminLee	5	Very convenient and easy to use	Love the Chromecast. It's very easy to set up and use!
4046	niche2425	5	Good pick up	I use this Chromecast to watch my subscription to YouTube tv. So far I'm loving it. Easy to use and install.
4047	vish	4	Chromecase.	the product works fairly wall. Google pixel has some issues connecting , but mostly works.
4048	fauno01	5	Perfect	Perfect choice for flats but olders tvs, í can cast netflix
4049	Mike	5	It works	Works as advertised. I can recommend this to anyone.
4050	NocableBX	5	Greatest purchase	Must buy .. easy to use, easy to setup we don't have cable but still watch much of netflix
4051	Anna	5	Works great!	Just had to plug it in, load the App into the phone and Netflix popped right up. Works flawlessly!
4052	tbarnes999	4	Works as Advertised	Coming from a Windows Phone which had so much more connectivity, it was an adjustment moving to Android and GOOGLE protocol. But if you're going to cast your phone under this operating system, this is the way to do it. It works well, and as advertised.
4053	Rissa	5	Awesome!	This chromecast is awesome! It was so easy to setup, and it is so easy to connect to my tv when i want to cast onto my tv.
4054	Sonnyboy	4	Great for streaming	Extremely pleased. Considered similar products. After careful consideration chose chromecast
4055	Timmy	5	Smart stuff , like it so much	It is a very smart device that i have ever had before
4056	DRock	5	Works Great	Great tool. We use it at work to project tablets on TV for training purposes.
4057	Bueler	5	Works great	Does what it needs to do and does it perfectly, Probably going to go back and buy a couple more
4058	moc18	5	Great TV accessory	I originally used a Google Chromecast so that I could cast videos and streaming services like Hulu and Netflix from my phone to my TV. This second generation device is even faster than the first version. Love the convenience and it's very easy to set up.
4059	antawnkreitzer	4	Great way to link a laptop to a bigscreen	Great product but Google did not make the process to lync a laptop using Google Chrome to the chromecast device very intuitive. The instructions provided are pretty useless. Had to mess around with the settings a few times before it worked.
4060	svn2020	5	Better than the previous vesion	Not too hot to touch after a long streaming like the first version. Better performance as well.
4061	Robert	5	Simple but robust	Chromecast is easy to setup and use for anyone familiar with modern basic mobile and television technology. If you use Google products or utilize an Android based device the Chromecast is an inexpensive way to broaden the utility of all your interconnected devices.
4062	Eddie	4	Works but could be Better	Currently the connectivity is a little picky with some devices. I thought it was wi-fi, but it usually lets you know of wi fi issues.Other than that, it works pretty well.
4063	MamaNelly	5	love it!	I get to watch anything i want now! this product is great!
4064	goddesscatering	5	Why haven't you bought this yet?	This is my 4th one.. I have one on all three TV's at home and now this one was for my office TV so that we can show clients videos on products from You Tube... Also, it's fun to have Google Home start playing Netflix and such on your TV..;)
4065	Yasmany	4	Good product	Very useful device. Needs to be restarted sometimes but in general, it works fine.
4066	Lola	5	Perfect..!!!	have recommended the chrome cast to everyone I️ know.. very convenient
4067	Yasmany	4	Good product	This is a very useful device, needs to be restarted sometimes but in general, it works fine.
4068	Envy1	5	good product for the money	I am Happy with my purchase and the no cost for the freebie
4069	Mama	5	Love it!	Have this device in every tv in my house and my parents house too!
4070	Sandy	5	It gets my Netflix to show	It gets my Netflix to show on the family room TV that is not 4K. Have enjoyed it for a while. Was easy to set up.
4071	Elisag10	5	Great for videos	Love that I can stream through my phone also I can go to YouTube
4072	Techhead	4	It is a good product for the price	The picture stutters from time to time. I have an enterprise gateway and APs. I also have cat 6 wiring, so my equipment is not an issue. The switch has also the flow control turned on. I am thinking the Chromecast can't handle the network speed so it stutters.
4073	Jasco	5	Works Great. Easy set up	Great product. Doesn't get anymore plug n play than this.
4074	sleigh918	5	love it	I love the chromecast. so incredibly easy to use and let's you use so many apps!!! no idea why people buy the more expensive ones, this one does the job just fine!
4075	RP11	5	Great product	Product is easy to install and works like a charm.
4076	Duane	5	Economical Streaming Media Player	This is a great Roku and Apple TV alternative. Needed a low cost streaming solution because my Roku player is unstable with CBS All Access. This was the least costly option with the opportunity to add a LAN connection ($15 option from Google). Working off of my iPad is easy and preferred to the Roku GUI on the TV screen. Resolution and speed of the device is excellent. I'd consider a second for my basement TV. Recommended.
4077	sean126	4	pretty good device	Bought this for my brother in law and him and his kids love it. He was able to do more things on his t.v. and as a result he was able to discontinue cable.
4078	Jerred	5	A good device for its use	A good and budget device to make your TV smart. Watching youtube can't be easier.
4079	DCall88	5	EASY set-up	Set-up was a breeze and took all of 5 minutes to begin to start streaming content! Love the ease of use! MUST BUY!
4080	Tomd	4	Good for what it does	I bought this so that I could cast from my MOTO Android cell phone to it and be able to watch a past PBS program that I was not able to find anywhere else. It did the job well.
4081	Treydawgs	5	Its alright	Woot woot. This thing worked alright. Bought it to coincide with my home automation
4082	Brenda	5	Very hand and easy to use	One of the greatest purchase I’ve made at bestbuy. Exceeded my expectations, something I’d highly recommend to someone.
4083	am1892	5	It's a great way to use youtube tv	...its a Google product for googling and casting and stuff
4084	Wizard	5	Great item	This is my 3rd chrome cast and I will get another so all my tv's have one
4085	Dillo	5	Terrific gizmo to cast content from your phone or	Device plugs into a free USB port on your TV and power from your wall. Works in the Google universe, Chrome browser. Many applications have specific cast buttons which lets you play your content to your TV. Wi-Fi setup is a breeze.
4086	JDRMichigan	5	Chrome cast Great add on	"Out of the box, quick, easy setup and in use to start streaming right away. Simple to use.
Great compliment to Google Home devices and application.
For the price, couldn't ask for a better combination."
4087	Lovelymej	3	Just a projector	This is great if you just want to project things. Otherwise it's a hassle for no good reason. There are other devices better suited for app usage with apps for projecting.
4088	RickPac	4	Great Cast Device	Simple. Small. Easy installation. You can cast your content to TV easy.
4089	Nubitek	5	A nust for the Android phone crowd!	If you use an android phone this is a must. I brought this for my sister and she loves it. We coupled this with a YoutubeTV subscription an she is now a true high tech cord cutter. She had been using Sling on the Roku but could not get local sports and local live stations.
4090	Albert	5	This chromecast has a lot more channels.	It’s the greatest chromecast now it’s quality much better.
4091	Karan	5	Awesome	Awesome chromecast, just loved it. Thank you bestbuy for a good deal.
4092	Caro	5	Great Deals	I like Best Buy App because it has great deals for students.
4093	Victor	4	Solid!	The Chromecast is amazing! The one thing that it could improve on is maintaining a longer casting time when casting the home screen of your phone.
4094	spud	4	Not perfect but works	A little more difficult to set up than advertised. Instructions not that helpful. Best Buy employees big help
4095	Gnerd	5	Google chrome cast	Beautiful, from phone or tablet to tv in two click
4096	Kevin	4	Good	This product for google- chromecast good image is also clear
4097	Mrmagoo	4	Pretty Cool Device	"This product makes your TV a voice control with all your apps and movies and TV streaming much easier to access. Instead of having to pull up each app such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Google Play etc... All you have to do is say ""Hey Google play Rocky on Netflix in the Master Bedroom TV and it will do it. The only con is that it you have to switch from your cable box to the HDMI port with the Chromcast device so your normal channels are not as easy to access or maybe i have not learned how to do it. Another great feature is it connects to your wifi so anything on the internet it can access and once your program your address you can ask it where is the closest grocery store or a Fast Food restaurant and it will tell you and it will give you the store hours. I really enjoy this device. It can also control your lights, door locks and AC."
4098	Acast	3	Has trouble being detected	I always have to unplug and plug it back in for the device to be discoverable. Mildly annoying but still worth using.
4099	fertlemyrtle	5	Love it!	It's so nice to be able to watch YouTube on my older TV!
4100	Mimi	3	It works, but connection is spotty	It works most of the time, however The connection to both my HDMI and WiFi is spotty. I’m not sure how this compares to other brand models, but more reliability would be a priority next time.
4101	Ronna	5	Works Great	I purchase art tutorials and have been looking for a way to watch them on the TV rather than my computer and this works nicely. I plan to purchase another one for an additional tv.
4102	Dirk	5	Better than promised	Set up was easy and the ease of use is great. Never have had any problems with the product.
4103	Starfish10	5	Great Product!	Easy to install, the videos show very clear on your tv.
4104	Terry	4	I returned it	I returned it because it wasn't what I really needed.
4105	ChuckyDucky82	5	Great for streaming videos!	I had heard of the Chromecast, but wasn't sure how it worked,at all.A friend of mine who had one hooked up showed me how it worked, and I ordered one the next day! It's so easy,and so great. Essentially if you don't have a Smart TV this device allows you to have one..Netflix,Pandora,YouTube,Hulu etc.if it's a video you can stream it..I love it!! Even can view pics and vids from personal gallery!
4106	BigManReview	5	Chromecast V2 - Improved	I had the original Chromecast on all 4 TVs but recently cut the cord and found out the new Chromecast is much improved on streaming performance for 1080P with Hulu and Google TV. Highly recommend if you want to avoid waiting/stutters during playback.
4107	CChe	4	A dirt-cheap wireless AV dongle that streams...	Using Android or iOS tablets as remotes, the Chromecast dongle streams Netflix, YouTube, Pandora, Google Music, Google Movies & TV, and HBO Go to your TV. Its relatively small size hides neatly behind a TV. Easy to take with you when traveling. The only negative is a lack of a dedicated remote requiring you to always need a smartphone or tablet nearby.
4108	Valisud	5	Excellent	The machine works great. For this reason I bought the second unit for my second tv in the house.
4109	jcdyed	4	Good but not great	It is a great play through device. I was hoping it had the capacity to download apps and play content directly. I was somewhat disappointed that it has to have another device (phone/tablet) to operate. It works really well and connects easily, there are just times I want my kids to be able to watch something without my phone being used to play the content.
4110	Praneeth	3	Not great as other streaming devices	When compared to roku and Xbox it has got only casting capabilities. Not more special about it
4111	josezamago	5	Top quality	You can't go won't when buying this. It's so useful and you don't have to pay much.

4113	revleroy	5	Great product. I'm extremely satisfied	This product makes viewing programs that I desire to watch more convenient. The ability to watch utube productions, etc. on the big screen is not only convenient, but is enables me to view with greater clarity. It gives me a more fulfilling TV experience.
4114	fms0219	5	Love it	Love it. Able to cast onto the big screen. Got one for each TV.
4115	Kris	4	Simple	Easy to install user friendly cool display. Good choice
4116	Cheryl	5	Love it	Easy to use and provides what I was looking for when I purchased
4117	Jonathan	5	Easy set up	Easy set up. Works great with phone, iPad, and computer.
4118	joyce719	5	Love my Chromcast	This is my second Chromecast. Nothing wrong with the first one, just like to update. Very easy set up. Works perfectly. Love it.
4119	Mike	5	We love the chromecast.	We love our Chromecast. It helps complete our house where we did away with traditional TV and now use Youtube TV.
4120	Bannah	5	Google chrome cast! Wow!	It’s unbelievable how this little thing can allow me to get numerous channels without the outrageous cable bils! Thank you Google!
4121	NALA	5	Better than previous ones	Purchased the new Google Chromecast to replace a first generation one. Definitely worth the $35, works like a charm compared to older models.
4122	Anthony	5	Great product for mirroring	This is a great product. It served the purpose that I intended it to serve.
4123	Rawbie	3	Good. There's better	"I LOVE how fast it is to cast something to this device, single tap of the button and boom your ready to go. That was google's main point about this device.

HOWEVER, using your phone as the remote control is ANNOYING. It almost always crashes when I use it, ill even have to reset the chromecast (as you can not restart it). This to me is it's downfall, how fast you are able to cast means nothing if you cannot control the dang thing.

Having to constantly reset the chromecast when It freezes also sucks, all in all this is great for youtube mostly where you wont really be needing to use controls. Everything is a toss up once you have to start using the controls.
 I would recommend the Roku streaming stick (2017). Tons of apps, remote control and it also has voice input."
4124	kurtxin	5	A Great add-on for your TV!!	This Chrome Cast work seamlessly with Google (Android devices, Youtube, Google play music) and other APPs like Reuters TV, PlayerXtreme! Very easy to use, high fidelity & beautiful screen savers. A Great add-on for your TV experience!!
4125	Juan	5	Great Casting Device	I love to be able to plug this in on my TV and to be able to cat Netflix and youtube on the TV from my phone! You can also cast Spotify. Overall really pleased with this device. So far no issues.
4126	jamal	3	Good	Good but takes some learning with home app kinda glitchy

4128	Mcle12	4	Great product for streaming	This product replaced streaming through a bluray player
4129	rdwade34	4	Chromecast makes our life easier at work	We're starting to use Chromecast to display our internal company dashboard. It's so much more affordable than previous options we've used.
4130	Compteltech	5	bought it for my mother in a nursing home.	I bought this for my mother who is in a nursing home . I was hoping to use it for streaming but found there wifi not to work in the home. So i am planning on using my phone as a hotspot to stream. This is my second one they work very well. If you have a google account you have to own one.. Enjoy
4131	skb83	5	Best streaming device	Best device if looking to stream everything except iTunes! Screenshare from web chrome is a great option to stream from laptop!
4132	zub89	5	Streams apps	Took me longer to get to the back of my tv than it did to get this up and running. Works great.
4133	Kail	5	simply great and easy to use.	Plug and play, easy to setup and use, works pretty well with Google home and home min.
4134	Midiboy	5	Casting away the cable (or satellite cord).	"We decided it was time to save $100 a month and cut the cord from cable TV. We rarely watched ""cable only"" channels and honestly, when CBS and DirecTV just entered their last dispute, it wasn't even worth it anymore. I started looking into other options and settled on the ChromeCast option (I bought 2). I already subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Prime, and for under $20 a month, I subscribed to both Hulu and CBS All Access and can literally watch every single show we watched with DirecTV with the exception of one show we liked on Hallmark. But they have that on VUDU, Amazon, and iTunes. So I can just buy the season when it completes...not a big deal and totally worth the money saved a month to month basis.

Now, for using ChromeCast...it's SUPER easy. You simply download the Google Home App, plug the device into your TV per the simple to follow instructions and then follow the few steps in the app to ""find"" the device. From there, you can cast videos from YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox (isn't working right now, but Hulu has most networks other than CBS), etc. right to your TV. It's actually SIMPLER to watch TV than it was with DirecTV. Less buttons to worry about. 

You can even cast videos from Chrome on your PC in most cases."

4143	McLITH	4	Works as expected	"I bought this so my daughter could ""cast"" her school's Chromebook to the TV. It works like Apple TV except that you do it from a Chrome browser instead of from your iPhone. Perfect for the price. I like that the body is magnetic and attaches to the cable - it makes for a cleaner look at the back of the TV."

4145	jakob	5	Simple to use, portable. Perfect	Simple to use, portable and not a battery drainer on the phone casting to it.

4149	Quimico	4	Affordable streaming and mirroring option	I own both an Apple TV and a Google Chromecast, and the Chromecast is an affordable streaming and device mirroring option. The only setback is that it doesn't interact well with my Apple products (which was expected), but plays very well with PC/Android tech. Overall, good deal.

Great for slide shows, pictures, videos, TV, movies etc....We even use them as art display on the larger wall mounted tv when not in use.
4157	BESTB1	4	Good quality, set up difficulty	Easy to use. Casting set up didn't always work. Kept asking me to setup. Probably me, not familiar with this stuff.
4158	user	5	great product	Works well and I have no problems or complications with this product at all.
4159	Dee84	3	Does not work with my phone	This product was supposed to mirror whatever was on my phone onto the TV. This product did not work with my Android phone.

4164	Mike	4	easy to install;product as described	I am poorly literate with IT so usually have to get son to help transition from laptop to big screen otherwise performs as intended
4165	MadSquabbles	4	Does its function well, but I'm still not a fan	I prefer dedicated streaming devices instead of a dummy terminal. I works fine, but I've got tons of streaming devices so I sold it.
4166	terry	5	Good Device	Works good. Can connect to tv and watch different shows on the apps.

4172	Maxim	5	Perfect streaming device for multiple devices	This chromecast is so easy and convienient to stream from my phone to my t.v at home. Best investment I made for a streaming device
4173	Lizzy	3	Well....	"Well I do love this product however what I HATE is that you HAVE to have some type of WiFi and it has to be in close proximity, if not you’re screwed. 
I thought it was plain Bluetooth, but jokes on me it’s not! 
I tried using it in Crested Butte hotel, however the WiFi was too far and wouldn’t connect. (Sigh)
So I ended up having to use my Hotspot on my phone, oh that’s another thing, I’m so glad I decided to bring my iPad mini with us as well because then I could’ve never used this product. If you use hotspot you HAVE to have two devices one to be the router (hotspot) the other to be like the remote. 
I would only recommend IF they knew everything about it and are willing pay for it. Yes it’s cheap and works well, however if you plan on going to a remote area most likely will not work."
4174	Glay	5	Good item	This item is best especially when there is dependable wi fi
4175	Meowzers	4	Great but only without wifi	The only way to avoid screen tearing is to plug it in directly, on wifi it just doesn't get data fast enough for a quality image.
4176	unicorn	5	It works really well	It works really well on my TV. Would recommend this
4177	texantravelers	5	A must have	We now own 4 of these and only have 3 Tv's. Super easy to setup, even easier to tap the cast button on your device with so many apps. The extra one we bought to keep with our luggage for use when we travel instead of just having hotel tv. Highly recommend.
4178	Cary	5	Great streaming	I can watch anything I want in Netflix, YouTube and even more
4179	doreen	5	Google chromecast	An excellent product that is easy to set up to stream all your favorite programs and movies. A must -have!

4199	maturedgamer	5	Decent	Quick and easy setup, and easy to sync streaming media to device.
4200	chrome	4	Great Product	Compared to the 2012 model Chromecast, Google’s newest dongle now supports 802.11ac dual-band networks and makes use of an adaptive antenna for vastly improved networking performance. Put simply, the new Chromecast won’t struggle with local streaming via Plex like its predecessor did
4201	mcv22	5	Works as expected	Was set up by a relative. I'm not technically inclined. It seems to work well and does what is supposed to do.

4214	Tvalentino	5	Overall awesome	This is the best chromecast yet no issues at all does more then the last gens
4215	Anon	5	Great product	Works great, zero complaints. I now have 3 of them and will buy more as needed.

4228	Jack1031	4	Works well.	Took a little time to set up but once completed it works well as far as streaming Netflix.
4229	Bailey1	5	Cut the cord!	I was totally ready to cut the cord and wanted something portable yet efficient. Easy to setup - practically plug/play. Just be aware that the streaming apps (for example: Netflix, Hulu, etc.) will need to be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet. Some may find this cumbersome but, if the Chromecast is being used on a TV that is seldom used it shouldn't be an issue. Note: I do use the Roku 3 on TVs that used on a regular basis.
4230	Nishu	5	Great product	I bought this for my LCD screen. Now my screen almost functions like a smart tv with this chromecast.
4231	MCNY	4	Worth the money	It was very cheap and it works most of the time. Need to restart sometimes but not a big deal

4237	Ryan	5	Must have	This is simply a must have. The ability to stream anything to any TV is great.
4238	Ber77	4	Works Well	"This Chromecast works well. One complaint - sometimes it does not show up in the available areas -- Such as ""bedroom"", ""living room"". Sometimes one will show up and not the other on the casting device. I have two Chromecasts. One in the bedroom and one in the living room."
4239	BNoel12	4	Great for the Price	Without going out and paying a bunch of money, this works really well, with not much lag at all. Would recommend!
4240	bcm705	5	Excellent Product	The google chromecast was quick and easy to install. I have not had any connection issues when casting from my iPad to my tv. This is excellent solution for cord cutters or for when the cable goes out.
4241	Love2shop	5	Works very well and lots of channels	I was a little hesitant about this product but the directions are very simple, easy to follow and it opened the world of several channels which gave me lots of movie options.
4242	DonJuanBonJovi	5	Great Value	For the price the functionality it provides is excellent. My Samsung phone had automatically connected to my Samsung Smart TV before I had this item, but not the connection is more seamless. I wish I had purchased the higher level model of Chromecast. The only thing I don't like is how it just hangs from the back of my TV. There should be a better way of connecting it.
4243	Rafael	5	Awesome	I have to say this product is well worth having. I use it everyday.
4244	rambo3865	5	great streaming device	this device definitely works as advertised and then some ! I have been using it to stream movies over all of my devices and it is amazing . The price was also on the money , definite bang for your buck .
4245	Mera	3	Much cheaper than apple TV	It works with my apple laptop by downloading google chrome as my browser and it is $35 compared to apple tvs $145. However I'm not sure if my internet is just too slow or the browser stinks but when I cast it to the tv it often struggles with the buffering. I'm not sure if the Apple TV would've been better or not but I just didn't want to pay that much to try it out. I'm wondering if it is just my internet service though since I live out of town and there is only one company that provides internet for us at 16mps being the fastest.
4246	stucrew	4	Like it	Overall I like it. It is great to mirror my laptop to my television
4247	HDTech	4	Perfect add on to my chromebook	Great add on to my tv to cast or display my chromebook screen or even just play music.

4259	Bsue	5	Great product!	Google Chromecast is as good as advertised and the perfect tool to use with our Google Home
4260	Julie	5	Great	I love this thing. I can stream my tablet to any tv with a HDMI. Sometimes it is hard to turn it off though so I have to unplug it.

4267	gd99	5	Mosts works well.	Sometimes there is a slight lag between the PC and projection screen. Otherwise it works well.

Both still work god and we use them on two tvs. I got a tv for my office and I only use chromecast to save on cable bill.

4326	Chris	4	Easy to Use & Setup	Tremendously easy to setup and use. Be it a laptop, phone, tablet - everyone in the house is able to throw up their video of choice. For those on Apple products, using Chrome as your browser allows it to work well. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to throw their subscriptions on a screen.
4327	alicia	5	Enjoyed the feature of using from my phone.	This has allowed me to have control of what my children watch right at my hand.
4328	Alliance	5	Met all my expectations	I like this version much better than the previous one
4329	Leapyear	3	It was confusing	IT WAS CONFUSING, AND DIDN'T WORK THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK. I DIDN'T LIKE THE CASTING TO TELEVISION PART. IT MAKES YOU TIE UP TWO DEVICES.

I recommend this highly"
4340	Lsis	4	Okay	I like the device, but actually prefer fire stick because it has Access to sites without having to stream from another device. Otherwise it's good for its purpose.
4341	DanPA	4	Better than first generation	Works well, good quality streaming and excellent connectivity.
4342	Dave	5	Love this product.	My built in Netflix app on my tv was giving me problems and the YouTube app was being discontinued so I bought this and couldn't be more happy. This works great and there is no buffering. Love it!
4343	Chris	4	Replacing broken older model	My older Chromecast broke at the HDMI connection, bad design put too much pressure on connection. This new model seems to have fixed the issue and should last longer. Setup was a bit more time consuming than I would have thought, not sure how the older model was, it was set up for me. Other than that is works great.
4344	TJE1012	5	Excellent	The device works exactly as represented.Very happy

4353	TeeTee	5	Works as expected.	Connects easily to the computer and the app guides you the rest of the way. Works similar to the screen sharing feature that you can use with Samsung TV's and phones, except you can connect to any TV from any Wi-Fi enabled device.

4372	SHA11	5	Chromecast	The chromecast device has been a good product for me. If you follow the simple directions on the t.v. Screen it takes very little time to start streaming. I am annoyed that NBC NY can’t be streamed on Chromecast.
4373	Macharapata	3	Casting is erratic. Flips in and out.	Easy to instsall. User manual needs more detail. Casting isn't stable enough.
4374	Booker	5	Very user friendly	Good product. User friendly. But does not cast prime video.
4375	HouMan	4	Very good streaming media sticker	"I purchased it about couple weeks ago and attached it to my 32"" LCD TV.

4386	nony	5	Love it!!	Love my Google Chromecast!!! Easy set up and install..
4387	Bubbatub	5	A gateway	"This device allows for your HDMI enabled screen to receive signals from whatever can cast to it. It has turned a slightly older HDtv into a device that is on par with other modern app enabled smart TVs.

4392	Anon	5	Works as it should	I've been using the Chromecast for a couple months now and have had 0 issues. However, initial setup took longer than anticipated as it turns out you can not get surround sound out of this using an optical audio cable (An all HDMI setup works fine). Overall I am pleased with the device and now have 2 of them.
4393	ShovelFighter	1	Never buy on Vacation	I bought this on Vacation and I was unable to use it on an open network in my hotel room. So I can't tell it works.
4394	Steve	4	Great, low-cost tool	This gadget allows me to stream anything on my computer to my TV , simply and quickly. My only problem is the appearance of a vertical line on the TV that can appear whether or not I am using Chromecast. An Internet search suggests this may be a problem with the TV rather than the Chromecast.
4395	carletti	5	Use it to upgrade your audio system	I have an old Jukebox in which I plugged it to make it bluetooth friendly.
4396	pablo	5	Great product	Chromecast was a lifesaver for my kids' TV. Bye, bye, cable!
4397	vickkie	5	Great Great Great	So easy to work with your Iphone or Android. I love it
4398	Pac85	5	Handy device for sharing on bigger screens	The Google Chromecast works great to share your phone or PC on a bigger screen. Why wouldn't you want to cast to the TV instead of trying to share a PC or phone screen? All around easier to see. Many more capabilities if you want them. 50 inch photo frame? Better sound for your music? Inexpensive enough to give it a try.
4399	Bobby	5	Great way to stream	Fairly easy setup and better priced than the competition.
4400	gsmall837	5	Great for easy casting to older Panasonic Viera	When your Smart TV comes from a time when BT was not a feature, this is what you need.
4401	FieldsFamily	4	Perfection	I wasn't sure if this was going to work for us after another attempt at going wireless failed but it's extremely easy to install, connect and use. Seriously it's idiot proof!! The one time it gave me a problem I rebooted it and it hasn't happened again.
4402	Eddie	4	Good portable device	It is small and easy to carry. I use it at hotels with free wifi when travelling.
4403	Geito	4	Goood	I used a lot, and is really nice and easy to use and instal
4404	Chromefan	4	Great buy!	Love my Chromecast! It works as advertised and is a great addition to the house. My only grip is the wifi setup. It took a few tries and some research as it has trouble connecting to my network but I was able to find a workaround.
4405	Mike	4	Good streaming	Good streaming from computer to television bought to watch a college football game. User friendly
4406	Gmrj	5	Excellent device	I bought this to replace a first generation Chromecast that had failed. The set up was simple and it just simply works.

4410	CasualMemer	3	Same cost as others for less features	It basically does what it says. Casts from you phone, computer or tablet. It cost about the same as a firestick but is limited. You can also cast to a firestick from phone and computer as well.
4411	Paty	5	Very pleased with this purchase	Purchased this google chromecast for my daughter and she likes it very much.
4412	Mckio	5	Easy to use	Easy to hook up and stream from my IPad. Have only used Netflix so far, but works great.

4430	Spends12hrsadayoncomp	5	Easy to set up. Easy to use.	I can't believe I waited so long to get it. I love casting Netflix and YouTube. It's also a great way to entertain visitors. So easy to use even toddlers and grands can cast.
4431	Bobby	5	Works as advertised	Connecting can be a little complicated your first time around but it is much easier than the early versions.
4432	Dave	5	great set of functionality for great price	I've bought multiple of these units. Love the ability to use my phone as the remote...instead of having to find yet another remote. Have a TV that uses CEC makes it super simple to switch to the Chromecast streaming. Also the love the fact that many TV's have Chromecast functionality built in (including a couple of TV's I own!).

4440	DarlaK	5	Works Great	Works Great! I like not having to connect additional power source. Plug and watch
4441	Pontiacforever	5	A necessity in my house	Every tv has one of these in my house if it doesn't have a streaming device hooked up through a blue ray player or gaming system. Works great everytime. Never an issue.
4442	trindap76	5	Nice Update	Had the 1st generation and this has been a great upgrade
4443	Wendy	5	great streaming device	I bought this device when I was a beginner in the world of streaming. This device is like a key that open to the new way to watch tv and movies, not being trapped with cable provoder. It's the great way for new entertainment these days.

4450	Maria	5	Great	I like it because i can see the movie in my tv, it is the best
4451	Pablo	5	Good form of tv	It’s good because you stream from WiFi from your smart phone
4452	TheFNShow1250	5	Very good system	Google went up against the rokus, amazon fire sticks, apple TV & is great at it. Screen mirroring, start in one room & finish in another & 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz network. The only annoyance I have with it is, it'll sometimes turn your system on if it detects the chromecast is active & hdmi cec is enabled. Add in chromecast ultra for 4k & hdr needs & you still are below $70 for either option.
4453	Yeya80	5	Great product	We bought this to be able to watch you tube and more in different rooms in our home and hasn't disappoint.. very good product. And awesome price.
4454	Ruby	5	Great	It’s so awesome we can stream from the phone and cast to my tv. It’s great when you don’t have a smart tv and want to watch Netflix or so

4459	Sam87878	5	Cool device	I like this device so good and easy to set up with my TV
4460	Booger	5	Great for non-SmartTV owners	This Google Cast is great! I have an older TV in the bedroom, and this allows me to stream all the content I want without upgrading my TV. Only complaint is an extra wire/plug coming from the TV, it'll be even better if HDMI could power the device.
4461	Shelly	5	Great Streaming product	Live my Chromcast works great on all my tv's anf8i get to see all the newest movies.GREAT PRIDUCT
4462	Stang70Fastback	5	It just plain works!	"What continuously surprises me about today's technology isn't its capabilities, but the ease with which it makes those capabilities accessible to the masses. The Chromecast is an excellent example of this. You plug it in, you download the app on your phone, it walks you through a series of very clear, simple, easy-to-understand instructions, and before you know it, you're good to go! It works very well, it keeps itself updated automatically, etc...

The only time we ever had issues with ours was when our obsession with converting our house to a Smart Home led to too many WiFi-enabled smart devices overwhelming our older router. Once I upgraded our home to a more modern router setup (a Linksys Velop mesh system), our occasional Casting issues vanished.

If I have any complaint, it's that normally when you're casting stuff, anyone whose device is in the house can see and (if you've allowed it) control the playback. However, in our experience, they still need to improve that system a bit because our phones don't always reliably display that information in the Notification Bar. So every so often if it disappears from both of our phones, it's a bit of a PITA to stop something that is being casted. This is a minor foible, though, and it seems to be occurring much less frequently than it used to, so they've definitely greatly improved it.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone. We have THREE. One for the bedroom, one for the living room (an Ultra) and one for the kitchen."
4463	carissaraye	4	Great	When I bought the device the salesman told me that it didn't require WiFi, it does by the way. It works great as long as you have that connection for your Chromecast. The set up process wasn't the easiest but once it's done it works smoothly.
4464	Kninio	5	Google Chromecast	Love, love, love. I love my Google Chromecast, it's totally the best investment.
4465	shml	5	Easy to install. Consistent & reliable.	Price is reasonable & current model performs efficiently. Love it!
4466	TKoga	5	Gadgets Abound	This product does everything it says. Works well first time and is a great choice from all to pick from.
4467	diswmb	4	Works good	Appears to work well for me. I am able to stream movies.
4468	Dave	4	Good what it is	Many apps can cast to TV with this, but many still do not. Also, sometimes I even have trouble casting Google Chrome, which really shouldn't happen. Still, easily worth $30-35.
4469	Cottontunes	5	stream	Stream movies to your tv with ease. Does a good job.
4470	campb4sa	5	Love it!	This is my second chromecast that I have bought for my home, and I love it! It makes watching Netflix and Hulu so much easier than before. Highly recommend this to anyone!
4471	JPastrana	5	Chrome cast	It’s a great feature. What you are watching on your phone, you can watch it on your TV.
4472	Leonano21	5	works great	go to youtube and do some research on what exactly it does. it does a great job of doing what it promises it will do.
4473	RJPG	5	Easy set up, fast streaming	Chromecast is very easy to set up. Simply connect the device to the HDMI port, and ac adapter. Use your phone or tablet to stream content to your tv. If you own a 4k tv or plan to buy one anytime soon, make sure that you get the Chromecast Ultra to stream 4K content.
4474	Bharath	4	Google Chrome cast makes life simple	No matter where you are going, you can always carry this. Makes life so easy
4475	barden99	5	works great, easy to use	hooked up easily, worked right away, no hassle, would recommend
4476	schamb	3	Nice But not what I expected	"Unlike a Smart TV you have to use an App on your phone to stream videos to Chromecast. If you want to use your Computer you have to use the Chrome Browser.

Works fine just a little annoying."
4477	Wiseone	5	Works Great	Allows me to watch free videos from the computer on the TV. You do need to switch the TV to a different HDMI input.
4478	Checkmate	5	It works	The Chrome cast unit works fine. It is being used to broadcast streaming internet to a large screen to review online data.
4479	halvoe	5	Awesome gadget	Couldn't be happier with this. We have one connected to each tv in the house.
4480	Christoforo	5	Watch Everything	I got a pair of ChromeCast units for my two upstairs TVs. They're great. I can switch between the two when I go from the living room to the bedroom. What's not to love?
4481	JonSnow	5	Convenient and required for streaming	Better than fire stick, better than Roku stick. Can stream easily anywhere WiFi HDMI is available. I take this unit when I travel to hotels so I can watch my own Netflix and Hulu (as long as there is internet).
4482	proudtexan	5	Great for entry level streaming	I got this for my parents to use to stream at their house and hey are able to use it easily...and they aren't techies at ALL
4483	AppleFan	4	One of the Cheaper Options for Streaming	"The Chromecast is a bit different than other streaming devices like the Roku or Amazon Fire in that your phone or tablet is the remote control. Any app that has the Chromecast logo in it can ""cast"" the video and audio, then the Chromecast takes over the streaming duties. The Chromecast contains no apps, and there's no home screen. It's quite a bit different than traditional TV and not for everyone. It integrates nicely with a Google Home. If you set up the Chromecast to control the TV (turning it on and switching input to Chromecast), you can tell Google Home ""play Stranger Things on the big TV"" and it knows Stranger Things is on Netflix and will start playing the next episode on the specified TV."
4484	Debbie	5	Chrmocast	Just pluck into my tv and I can watch all of my movies I have in the cloud so easy to use
4485	Ameg	5	Excellent	Nice device, click response using on the phone, many apps to use with.
4486	jt7928	5	Turned my TV into a smart TV	Now I am able to watch YouTube TV and Youtube red from my TV. Instructions are very easy.
4487	Charley2016	5	Makes a great gift	This Chromecast makes a good gift for those that don't have smart TVs. They are easy to set up and use and are portable to use on multiple TVs or at hotels to stream Netflix or HBO apps. I have bought several for family members and friends. Only downside is you need a different device to stream Amazon Prime.
4488	Roostr	5	Great Buy	Great product easy to setup and use. Works perfect with our Google Home.
4489	EricaD	5	Awesome, easy to use product	We purchased a Google Chromecast to use on our television in the living room, and it has been a GREAT addition to our tech devices. The product itself is completely contained to the backside of the tv set, creates no clutter, and works like a charm. I can use my cell phone, ipad, or computer to control it and have had no issues with it whatsoever.
4490	Alagu	5	Gift for my wife’s parents	I bought this as a gift for my wife’s parents. Works as expected on their Samsung LCD TV
4491	Romanxlx	5	Great for the college student in a dorm or apt	Got this for my daughter who is away at school and streams her entertainment. Easy setup and excellent picture. No technical issues like I had with my 1st gen Chromecast.
4492	jtoast	3	It does what it claims	This device does what it claims which is to send media from your phone to your tv/other device. A few years ago it would have rated 5 stars. Now that most modern electronics have the ability buit in, its less revolutionary.
4493	TechEnthusiast	5	Good easy choice for streaming to the TV	Really good streaming quality and performance. Seems to be the most universal way for apps to stream to the TV.
4494	edward77	3	Google - Chromecast - Black	it took a while to setup, but, it was easy to use.
4495	rjazme	5	Easy to use	It was a gift for my nephew and he use every day and better than me.

4497	Steve610	5	What a great product !! Cancel Cable Subscriptio	This replaced my cable subscription, and saved me $110/month in cable subscription fees. I use it to stream my HULU and Netflix subscriptions, which combined, saved me over $100/month on my cable bill. Works perfect every time.
4498	baylady	5	Great Product	This worked the minute I plugged it in. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great product with a great price.
4499	Vikash	5	Great product from Google!	As expected, this works really well. Literally comfort at your hand. I like playing music from Google music from my bedroom and streaming it on my TV in living room with full volume! Pure Bliss!!
4500	Marc	5	Works perfect	This product with my Hulu suscription lets me watch shows on tv and saves the expense of a cable bill.

4504	Psicom26	3	It’s ok	It’s ok I would just stick with Apple TV it seems to be easier to jse
4505	Suebaru2010	5	Chromecast	I recently purchased a Chrome cast to be able to stream Netflix. It is awesome to be able to watch so many movies and series I may or may not have been able to watch on cable channels. The chrome cast provides such a great way to get to watch an infinite number of shows.
4506	curlyheadedwitch	5	Opens a new world of fun on your tv!	Very easy HDMI connection to your television, allows you to watch You Tube videos, Netflix, an HBO product, Hulu, and more. Some of those require a subscription and if you already have a subsciption (we do to Netflix), just sign in as you normally would do. No more trying to watch tiny images on your phone! I haven't tried other apps yet, but the salesman told me there are many apps that can be viewed on the television with this product. Ios (Apple) users note~~you have to sign into Chrome to be able to view things with this device. It won't bring up anything with the Safari browser on iPhone.
4507	Jenn	5	Love my Google Chrome!!	Device is great for watching MLB.com on the big screen!!!
4508	ems154	5	The 2nd one....	This is the second unit I bought, one for the living room and the other one bedroom. They're both great, I highly recommend it.
4509	CHeil402	4	It Works	This is great for casting things from your Android phone or Chromebook to a TV, but the only annoying thing compared to a similar device like Amazon Fire TV (which I also own) is that there is no physical remote. You need to use your device to control it. Would be nice if it could work independent from a device, like the Fire TV. But other than that, it works fine.
4510	budmother	5	Great for a college kid	Bought this for our daughter so she could watch TV shows in her college apartment. Works great and she loves it. Easy to hook up and easy to use. Will definitely purchase for my other daughter as well.
4511	Torch	5	Great product	Good price easy to hook up and easy to use good service at the Brandon store.

4518	Dbl2lew	4	Works well with smart phone	Hooked up very easily, easy to set up and start using. Wish you could use it independent without a device.
4519	Robb	2	Returned the unit	I didn't care for these dongles. With smart TV's in the house the use case was limited.
4520	Jack	5	Good value	Happy with purchase. A great value for the price. I would definitely buy these again.
4521	d3penguin	5	Wotks Great	I was skeptical about this but it works just as advertised. Love it
4522	412341	4	Nice accessary	Great product and very easy to set up. Highly recommend
4523	spoondono	4	'Lesser' Chromecast still good	I used to have the newest Chromecast that could handle 2.4 and 5gHz networks, but a family member stole it, so I had to buy another one. This one is still fine and a lot of the bugs that came about when Chromecast was first introduced have been fixed with software updates. You can see a slight difference when not using a 5gHz network...It also depends how many devices you have running on your 2.4gHz network. If you adjust accordingly and don't have a horrific internet provider, this should work just fine.
4524	Shanmugasundaram	4	Good for casting Movies.!!	Google Chromecast is very good for casting movies,you tube vedios.etc..
4525	Bull	5	love it	Works great! easy set-up! I had never purchased before because I thought it would be difficult to set up. I was wrong.

4529	Tetris	4	goos product	better than the previous one and easy to set up and use
4530	astr0	5	Great for watching movies	It works great as long as you have a decent Wi-Fi connection.you don't need a tech to come out like you do with the firestick.plug in download the proper apps and you got movies at the cinema from home
4531	SkellyKeeler	5	Convenient	Very convenient device for watch things in big screen even though most smart tv offer smart tv function now. This product is great alternative for people who don't have smart tv functions. Highly recommended

4533	MR123	5	So much better than cable	I got this a while ago, and use it constantly. It is so much cheaper than signing up for cable tv, and I never have any problems getting it to work. It works with pretty much any app you'd want to connect to the tv (netflix, youtube, Hulu, etc)

Chromecast (coupled with Google Chrome's desktop or tab mirroring) works PERFECTLY for what I like to do. Play stuff on my PC and have it appear on my TV for when others are viewing as well besides just myself. Crystal clear HDMI quality streaming (if your internet/wifi is strong enough), No lag at all with sound or video.

All around great product, and also has native compatibility built-in with almost every popular streaming app. Netflix, Youtube, Twitch, Crackle, HBO, the list goes on and on. Highly recommended!"

4633	Blue	5	Easy to use	Love Chromecast, so convenient and easy to use. The whole family is able to use from their own pH.
4634	Vikie	4	Not what I expected	I have more luck with the Amazon Fire Stick. I do not like how this does not work unless you have a phone or tablet to cast it from. Even then, it loses connection easily. I have only used it for 5-10 times, now I have a Fire Stick from my mom and it seems to work a lot better.
4635	Kajuna06	5	Better that the original	I have the original and this one much better and faster.This is a must.

Great for controlling music for a house party vs using Bluetooth speakers."
4648	Reijiruo	5	Great Device to stream to	I love the chromecast, it allows me to stream from my phone, tablet and laptop. Everybody always has their phone on them and it doesn't require users to turn on a separate device to watch shows from your favorite app.
4649	Mark	4	Hands Free	I got this for my smart TV because I own Google Home and thought I would give it a try with voice. Well if you are into the new smart devices out there this is one too cool. I am so glad I got the Google Home over Alexia as you can access most while out as well if you are an Android user
4650	Shae	5	No more cable!	I use this every day and no longer pay for cable services. Everything you need to watch can be streamed right here!
4651	TheDonMega	4	New design is okay	Not sure hhow I feel about the new design but the new added features makes you forget about it after a couple days. Overall still a great product by Google.

4657	aznfob18	5	wow	best product for pc ever that i bought at best buy

4659	Neonee	4	Sometimes it crashes	This is my second Chromecast. They tend to freeze up or has issues with wireless connection.
4660	Jd28	5	Wireless multimedia	I brought this to connect to my mini projector so I would have less cords and more freedom! It works great, every bit as good as the original but maybe more stable and faster as it should be.

4663	Aliya	4	Hands free	Great product paired with Google home. Very reasonably priced
4664	vikthor	5	Great for smart and non smart tv	We have a smart tv that isn't very smart. Chromecast makes it easy to stream too! We home school and use our tablets as digital blackboards with the tv which is fantastic! We stream most of what we watch and chromecast makes it easy!
4665	Demrock66	5	Great device	Works great. Cheaper than cable!!! Works great with Moto G5 plus cellphone.
4666	chadwick75	5	Love chrome cast	I have 3 of these and even if ypu have a smart tv the crome cast delivers exceptional performance and i find when streaming netflix or hulu it doesn't buffer as much as the actual smart tv. This also makes and HDTV a smart tv. Great for travel and works on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks for better performance where many smart devices only worknon 2.4ghz where performance is slower.
4667	ffware	5	Best gadget find in a long time	I love being able to cast from my phone or tablet to my large flat screen TV. It works flawlessly. Makes me look like a professional Movie Maker. I also like to stream many apps to my TV as well. Easy to use. I would definitely recommend it.
4668	Bboy305	5	Awesome!	This device is great for sharing family photos and watching videos..
4669	Monse	5	Best thing ever	Best thing ever, super easy to install, love it!..

4671	Vinny	5	Great product!	"I love being able to cast YouTube videos to my 67"" TV! Plan to buy a few more so I can have them on every thing in my house."
4672	Subhansobia	5	Awesome product especially if your television...	I love using Chromecast on my TV as I don't have a smart TV. Very easy to connect and fun to use. I watch YouTube on my TV all the time using Chromecast.
4673	Ddot	5	Great streaming device	I like being able to use my phone or tablet to cast straight to my tv.
4674	Raiden	4	Watch on larger screen	Works well. Casting YouTube is easy. Sometimes for whatever reason you have to reset, but works again. When internet is weak, however, then the casting lags or drops.
4675	Mobius	5	Works as expected	Easy setup. easy to use. easy to hide in your setup. Honestly a necessity for cable cutters and anyone who wants their internet content on their TV.
4676	Melvin	5	Great product	"Great purchase.
Plug and play anytime, anywhere! Glad for this buy."
4677	Akee	5	So easy to use! Highly recommend!!	Bought this product because I was looking for the smaller HDMI converter so I can watch NETFLIX thru my phone, while connected to a flat screen tv. Well it works much better, and I don't have to leave my phone plugged in next to the tv. It's wireless and easy to use. Even apple TV doesn't compare. I have to log in to NETFLIX every time I was using apple TV. 2 thumbs way up!!
4678	Mike	5	Great product	Great product and looks better than the first models out.
4679	Nancy	5	Awesome!!	Chromcast works awesome. I had one before and bought another one
4680	Maferoca	5	So cool	"Works very good with any device
Recommended to my family and friends"
4681	copper	5	works great	Have other chromecasts and this one is like the other. Very easy to set up and works great
4682	Terry	5	Great buy	Instantly turned my tv into a smart tv using my phone and tablet a the remote. Very convenient
4683	MikeInTO	5	Chromecast just works	Nothing could be easier. Plug it in, power it up. Connect your tablet or phone and you are on your way.
4684	Anoop	5	Awesome Product	Setup was very easy. It works great with Google Home. I can ask Google home to show my photos, watch a specific show on Netflix.
4685	Mike	4	Works fine but Roku is better	I have used Roku devices for years now, from sticks to Roku run TVs. I bought the Chromecast to mess around with and to use on the road where I can stream from my phone instead of making a hotspot. It is clever in its simplicity and is useful as an additional device but I wouldn't pick it as a primary streaming device. For that go with a Roku, they have best interface and user experience hands down.
4686	Nini08901	5	Great	I have 5 of these at home better than cable , all you need is to Send to
4687	TulsaHoo	4	Enables me to see stuff on TV from my computer	Works well. Limitation is speed of transmission in rural area
4688	aflores95	5	Great device	Great substitution for any other device. Great price
4689	Irocktees	4	As far as features v price, you can't beat it	At this point almost everyone knows what a Chromecast is and their most basic uses. I bought this latest one, my 3rd of the 2nd generation, to serve as the brain for a digital photo frame. Pulling photos from Facebook and Google photos I took an unused monitor and repurposed it as a full time slideshow and part time media center. And like I said, for the price you can't beat it. My sole gripe is that Chromecast and Chromecast audio are two separate products. I'd love if they were one, even if the price happened to be a little higher.
4690	JayRay122	4	Easy to use	This product is easy to use. I love it. Totally recommend it if you don't have a smart TV
4691	Decent	3	Works with only certain apps.	I bought the device thinking I would be able to show whatever is on my iphone on the screen of my enabled television. But the reality is that whatever you want to see on your tv must first be able to be seen from an app that recognizes the device. It does work well if you want to see things like youtube. Dont fully recommend, but it works well with those apps.
4692	Shinim	5	Best streaming device	This is a great product. Best streaming device at a great price.
4693	Yve07	4	Love my Chromecast	We bought this one to replace the one we lost. It works good with our tablet. We cast our netflix shows with no issues.
4694	AracelisL702	5	Casting Queen	I love my chrome cast, I use it everyday since my Sony Google TV can not download Hulu App. I cast it from my iPad
4695	Yvonne	5	Great gadget	Bought as a birthday gift for my son. He loves it. It charges his phone really fast. I ended up buying one for myself.
4696	LeoW	5	Great	Easy to use, just what I was looking for to share iPhone to tv
4697	Cameron	5	Great, and very low price	The google chrome cast is one of my favorite tech products because it allows you to do so much for such a low price
4698	Cywq	5	Works vey well	Makes it really convenient to play pgotos, video from Android devices
4699	Mykole	5	Simple, and cheap	It's a good device to pass apps on your phone to Tv such as YouTube , netflix, etc.
4700	Abhishek	5	Best Streaming Device	Best Streaming device in the Market. I have been using this for 3+ years now.
4701	Meagan	5	Very helpful	Great for streaming anything on your tv! Super easy to use.
4702	Dbev	4	Chromecast	Love being able to use this item to watch videos I have on my phone directly to the tv.
4703	Karen	5	I love my chromecast	Great for streaming shows from my iPad. It's super easy to install and is nice to be able to watch on the tv instead of trying to watch on a small iPad.
4704	Sweetpea	4	Not what we needed	The chromecast did not have the capability we needed. No problem with the product. Returned and the customer service rep was great
4705	Msito	5	Absolutely love it	I use it all the time for casting movies or shows from muy phone.
4706	Cubbies	5	Very convenient	Easy to set up and to use. Compatible with many apps like Netflix, HBO Go and Hulu. Responsive. Very good alternative if you don’t want to pay for a cable.
4707	Vivek	5	Make any screen a smart tv	Love using this to watch netflix and hulu. The desktop feature that shows photos from your Google photos account is pretty good as well.
4708	WanderingPanda	4	From Phone to TV	Chromecast is easy to connect and use. I only gave 4 stars because sometimes there's a problem with the connection, but otherwise it's a great device to watch videos on TV and able to leave the app that is playing the video and use my iPhone on something else. I mainly use chromecast on YouTube and Dramafever apps.
4709	Sam2017	5	Great device	A great device to pug in for accessing the online streaming
4710	Brig	5	Great device	I like how small this device is. I can travel with it and use it anywhere.
4711	311longhorns	4	Great product if u have Wifi	Great product to Display on Tv if u have access to Wi-Fi.
4712	Nottechy	5	Great	This product performs exactly as it should. Great buy!
4713	PlayerOne	5	Works	This worked for what I needed. I had the older version of this, but it quit working. This was extremely easy to set up. It only took me a couple of minutes.
4714	Mary	4	Great product	Very good product it works with any device and is user friendly
4715	Dasharatha	5	Excellent	Excellent easy to use. Photo and video quality is so perfect
4716	dcdad	5	It's google	Google technology is well tested and it works. Better than the original version
4717	LJ34	5	Chrome for your home	great product, better than the first one, syncs fast
4718	Kageasaurus	4	Decent for the price	Chrome cast is cheap and it helps create a seamless connection between your phone and tv. Over time, my phone has struggled to connect to chromecast, however this could be related to my Wifi and not the device itself. Overall I've been fairly happy with this product!
4719	kenstar2	5	Easiest setup ever	Excellent quality, works great with ipad,also works with Android and Chrome browser.
4720	Ctv715	5	Awesome gadget	Always needed something that would make it easy to stream my phone to my tv. This was it
4721	Mike	5	Great product	I love being able to cast my screen to my students while teaching. I would recommend.
4722	Scoobyloui	5	Great device for casting!	Google has created a very good product. Very easy to use and install. Works well with iPhone and Android.
4723	zakk	5	Great product	this product will never let u down you can do almost everything with it streaming your phone, youtube, running pictures on tv
4724	Stevefam	3	So far it seems to do everything it says it will	The only complaint I have is the directions are virtually non existent
4725	Nando	5	Great Google cast	Great cast technology from your device tp TV and it is not disturbing your task on your device
4726	Tyler	5	Great product	Great overall product, I bought it to take on a trip and be able to cast to my hotel room tv. Works great for this as it's just plug and play, then you can watch Netflix or cast your laptop to a larger screen
4727	AGK4779	5	Fun, Easy	Inexpensive way to cast any device onto a big screen.
4728	HuntersMom	5	Easy Install	Very happy with purchase. Hooked up to TV and works great.
4729	Timusa1234	4	Easy to set up	Perfect device , nice deal, make regular tv to level up...
4730	Wolfie89	5	Perfect	Was easy to install and runs smoothly with my devices
4731	Luis	5	Second one bought	I think being this being the second one I get speaks for itself .. great gadget !
4732	RandomTechGeek	4	Simple to Use	Very easy and quick to setup using the Google Home app. Support for lots of Android phones and iPhone. Supports Mac mirroring from Chrome browser. Only drawback, does not have a remote controller unlike other streaming devices. Not all TV remotes work fine with this.
4733	Alex	4	Make Any TV Smarter	With owning several Chromecast (Both Gen. 1 and 2) and being paired with Google Home, they are truly powerful little gadgets. Easily attach them to any modern TV and your off to streaming just about anything you can think of. The only downside, which is why they are so cheap, is the fact that they are reliant on a device (Phone, Tablet, Laptop, ETC.), but this can be easily overlooked in today's world.
4734	Paws	5	Great for price	I love it. My family watches Netflix often and this comes in handy when someone else is using the smart TV. Since it is small and portable we are able to use it when we are at a friend or family's house that has Wi-Fi.
4735	DrDisrespect	5	So good	All the good. Chromecast is some of the goodest good out there.
4736	idolator	4	Good for the price	The Chromecast works well MOST of the time. Sometimes I get a lot of stuttering even with a good wifi connection and my laptop only a few feet away from the Chromecast. I notice more problems when my roommate uses his older laptop, so I would recommend only using a fast computer to cast webpages.
4737	Kenny	5	A great casting device	I owned a Chromecast Ultra and Apple TV 4K before I bought this Chromecast. I bought this regular Chromecast for my little girl watching ChuChuTV from YouTube. It is very easy to setup and use ...
4738	Dask	5	Chromecast is why I'm using the TV again	Yep. For years, I haven't really been using the TV in our living room. I've been bound to using my computers for work and entertainment because the services that the Internet provides is far more convenient for me. I think the dullness that cable services provided just ended TV in general for me. But Chromecast brought it backf or me. I mostly use it for Netflix and YouTube but I don't think I've explored the other services I can cast on my TV. It reminded me how much better it is to watch things on a larger screen. I plan on adding more around the house soon!
4739	Diamond	3	Upgrading from 1st gen Chromecast	"I upgraded because my old Chromecast had issues with connectivity - particularly the frequent disconnects.

Didn't really resolve that. I have an AC1900 wireless router that gets decent speed with other devices. 

It's bigger than the first gen also. Not a huge deal as it just dangles from the AV receiver. 

Overall the Chromecast is a neat little device for streaming services. Can't say whether this is better than Roku or other devices."
4740	Damazing	4	Nice add on for older tv's	This is a great way to extend the life of an older tv without having to spend the money to completely replace it. Any tv with a USB port can basically be turned into a smart tv for less than $50. Well worth it!
4741	Jmknox	4	Works great with chrome browser.	"Works great with chrome browser. As well as the apps. Very easy 
setup."
4742	Mcollier	4	Nice Product!!	Very pleased with this product. Would definitely buy again!
4743	Goofstein	5	Good Solution	I was looking for a way to watch YouTube Tv in a secondary room and this works great.
4744	bhere	5	Super	A lot to offer. Takes some time to learn all the possibilities. Works seamlessly. Easy setup.
4745	jayroy1	3	Relatively easy set up to stream video	This product is great. However, the instructions are a bit confusing from Google. The set up took more than 1/2 hour and confusing instructions added to time and frustration. The Apple TV set up was a far easier endeavor. Otherwise it works well once everything online.
4746	FeCh	5	Worth It	I also own an Amazon Fire stick, but also having a Chromecast is definitely worth the extra spend. Love that I can control it through the Google Home App.
4747	MicrowaveForWork	3	Difficult Connecting	Had difficult connecting to TV, returned for apple TV.
4748	jromberg	5	Chromecast	Works well easy setup, designed for portable devices not the PC
4749	Dickie2306	5	Solid	This product works great as described, but the first one I purchased didn't. I returned it with no problem & haven't had a problem since!
4750	Morgan	5	Best Stream Device	Very small and easy to hide with g reat signal detection, this is the best streaming device.
4751	Littles	4	Awesome product	This is such a great way to watch things in your phone on the big screen. Highly recommended! Easy to use!
4752	steelemin	5	WORKS EXCELLENT	All my device are captured and displayed well from my iPhone and iPad and transferred to my TV.I like the ease and pleasure of this product and its capabilities.
4753	NYDENNIS	5	works great	just plug in and start using phone and tv work great together
4754	BigVon56	4	I would recommend this item to a friend	Still learning how it works but I like it on the TV
4755	RushR40	5	Makes a smart TV smarter.	My smart TV is around 3 years old. The YouTube app stopped working and the other apps we're getting outdated. The Google Chromecast brought it all back up to date. Great product!
4756	MWilson	4	Works well	Works well, have no complains, cable is long enough for me.
4757	Alex	5	Awesome streaming device	"Does what it's supposed to well, easy to connect to, and a pretty good bargain for the price, helped turn my ""dumb"" TV into a smart TV"
4758	LR21	5	Overall good product for the money	Works like it should, good product for the money, would recommend
4759	prida	5	practical	excellent quality, never loses the frequency, allows to carry the functionality smart to any television
4760	Richard	5	Great Product!!	Worked flawlessly! This is exactly what I was looking for and its just so convenient in turning a regular old tv into a smart tv
4761	Patrick	5	Does what I need	The wife and I are able to use our older hd tv to cast all our favorite shows
4762	JanAmata	4	Great Product if Used	I bought my chromecast thinking I would use it more but don't. I would say this is perfect for playing games with friends, listening to music at a party, playing videos in a flash if your TV is always on, or a Google product enthusiast (me). Consider the uses of this item for you before you buy it and make sure that it will not go unnoticed. The starting screen is the best part for me, along with the Google Photos and Slides integration/partnership.
4763	Yshbair	5	Great	"It does the job on a perfect way. With android you can mirror your mobile, you can cast your laptop as well.
Recommend it."
4764	jag982	5	GREAT	Excellent product and easy to use. Great to watch programs.
4765	Yaoming2	5	excellent	Good buy indeed. I use it to stream YouTube video for my kid. They love it as there's a huge variety to keep him entertained

4769	TheBikeGuy	4	streaming	This is alright if you want to use your phone.It works
4770	Quark	5	Chromecast gets an A	I bought the Chomecast for professional presentations of web videos. It wasn't perfect and it took some practice to use, but I found it to be very effective and functional. I'm very glad I got it.
4771	Jased001	5	Works without a hitch	This Chromecast was easy to set up and it performs flawlessly. It has good connectivity bandwidth and delivers a great high def picture.
4772	Reelluv	3	Somewhat Dated	Decent product but a little dated. Works well with older television that don't have streaming services included on the television.
4773	Danny	5	Great product	Great product. Extremely easy to set up. Much better than using the HDMI cable, plus that you can connect it to the phone and project from the comfort of your sofa. Totally recommend it.
4774	ThatGuy12	4	Awesome way to connect your phone to your TV	I use this almost everyday and gives me the easy way to connect what I'm watching on my phone straight to my TV.
4775	Kawiguy81	5	Awesome device, very useful for entertainment	Awesome device, very useful for entertainment, casting, screen mirroring, turns any TV into a Smart TV
4776	ejkb	4	Chromecast works well	Easy to install and set up. I would like it better if it had a remote control.
4777	DanB	5	Pretty cool	Its nice to be able to cast from my phone without running wires to my tv
4778	Memo	5	Great	User friendly and great product for a great price!
4779	JMETravel	5	Fast setup and reliable performance	We have two of the older Chromecast dongles and have always had intermittent problems staying connected ... or even getting connected without restarting the Chromecast. Since installing this new version, we have reliable and quick connections. In fact, this is probably what will convince us to finally say goodbye to the hated Comcast.
4780	JoeA	5	Easy to set up and use.	Use your phone or any Android or IOS device as the remote control. Easily send any web page to your TV when using the Chrome browser.
4781	Alec	5	Super Easy to Use and Fast	Perfect for anyone that doesn't have a smart TV or another type of connected device.
4782	Dhem	5	Easy to use and works great.	I bought this so I could cut my cable and stream straight from my phone. The Chromecast is Easy to use and works great.
4783	Jbacon78888	5	Works amazing	Love the Chromecast so much stream all my music and my Netflix with it. Would highly recommend to anyone
4784	kcm63	5	Love it!	Let's me cast using my laptop even though my tv doesn't have a browser.
4785	isha	5	Amazing Device	"This is a must have device! I cast stuff from my computer to the TV with no problem, it works very well.
I like it very much!"
4786	Ranger38	5	Great	The product is very good and easy to use. I will definitely Recommend it to another person
4787	imoy	5	Thumbs up	Great Chromecast, I have been trying to eliminate the need for hdmi cable, with the chromecast i can project a movie from my laptop and at the same same work on other things
4788	Mattman385	5	Excellent device	Works great and has a great connection to my WIFI. I wish i could vast Amazon prime
4789	GMAT	5	Works perfectly	I bought this to replace my old chromecast which lasted me about 3 years.
4790	Christian	5	Fun to use	I use this with my friends and family a lot when we want to watch Youtube on the TV. It's easy to use and pair.
4791	austburn	5	Great Chromecast	I upgraded my Chromecast just to be able to use the 5GHz wifi - so worth it! Faster load times!
4792	Sagar	5	Worth spending	Easy to share screen and files. Easy setup. It don't take much time to setup. Plugin use google home app to setup start sharing.
4793	Tweezy4	5	Works great	No problems with the streaming and it was easy to setup.
4794	AlexH	5	Works.	Better than the original, probably not as good as the ultra. Perfect for what I needed.
4795	marksox	4	Would have given it a 5 star but...	I would have given it a five star however the ethernet connection does not work.
4796	Dtre	5	Love having chromecast!!	Love this item. Let's me see different types of interest from my phone to my tv at my convenience.
4797	VJHouston	4	Meets expectations	Knew what to expect from it, and it meets those expectations.
4798	sue68	5	Chromecast	I bought Chromecast for my bedroom. Again, easy to install, to use and has a great picture on Netflix. Very enjoyable.
4799	ledbulbs	5	Work Seamlessly	It is good to send your computer/cell phone movie or streaming play to TV. Previous Chromecast was USB powered and can be seen after turning on TV. This Chromecast has DC powered and you can see the device from your phone and send it easily and it makes your TV on automatically.
4800	Onlineshopper23	5	Works great!	Works awesome! Great picture quality and i love the fact that my phone is the remote. So far i have used playstation vue, netflix, and fox sports go without a problem.
4801	RusG	5	Must have	Google chrome is great, fast, and responsive. One flaw is that Amazon Prime videos can't be streamed to chromecast. Also there are certain moments when the chromecast and the item casting from (eg, iphone) are dissociated briefly, but they reconnect within seconds.
4802	Optimus4	5	Great device	Great to watch wrestling streaming services cooler
4803	ramsay	4	Google as always!	Its been there for a long time now. Got my third chromecast!
4804	Cece	5	Great product	The Chromecast allows me to view my movies etc on my computer while using the phone as a remote to control.
4805	monkey	5	Love Casting	The chromecast was easy to install and the app makes it simple to run. Wow! Realized what I was missing.
4806	Maggie	5	Great for tv	This is a must have for college and home with no cable available. I can use my phone to cast Netflix & Amazon to my TV.
4807	Anotsohappycustomer	1	Doesnt work in India	Bought it for my family in India. But it doesnt work in India
4808	mraveling	5	Does exactly what it says it does	Appreciate the ability to be able to send video, photos, etc to a bigger TV screen. No real issues with the wireless (I had one time where I had to reconfigure but that wasn't too difficult). Would buy again.
4809	Guardian	5	Great Product for Anyone	I love this new version of the Google Chromecast, the design makes it so much easier to connect to the back of the television if it is on a mount, and between other plugs. Also, it seems to connect faster!
4810	Robb	5	Very convenient for watching YouTube and Netflix!	I mainly use this to watch YouTube and Netflix. I already have YouTube and Netflix on my phone so all I need to do is press the cast button and bam! The video, TV show, or movie is suddenly on my TV. This is great for me since I always have my phone with me and you don't need a remote to control what you want to watch. Anyone in your family that's connected to your Wi-Fi can also cast. It's extremely easy to share or watch something together with this little device (it's pretty tiny). I love this more than any of my other smart devices, it's portable and works great. I've never had issues with it unless it was a problem with a certain app going slow. It's certainly not the Chromecast's fault, sometimes the app being used is wonky on its own. I've never had problems with YouTube, Netflix, HBO Now, VUDU, etc. Low rated apps like DirecTV Now and FandangoNOW don't work as well, but that's on the app. I love my Chromecast and I recommend it to anyone who uses their phone constantly.
4811	AVR7	5	Great product for streaming on TV	I love this Chromecast and I feel this is a great innovation for streaming on TV. I already have one and I bought now this one for my dad.
4812	meme58	5	works well	My son got this for me because I needed something in order to stream Netflix and Hulu my WII had stopped working. It works well
4813	umustbcrazee	5	Works wonderfully!	Was skeptical at first, but after using it, it is extremely convenient!
4814	AnneKim	5	Solid follow-up to original Chromecast	Loved the original Chromecast, so I got this one for my parents and they are able to watch all their YouTube on the big screen!
4815	Krish	5	Works good	Now I can cast all the videos from my laptop. The product is awesome
4816	Nick	5	Great product, recommended to all	"I have two of these. They are incredibly convenient and work well with no problems. Most networks/services have an applicable ""cast"" button in the apps + you can cast non-compatible things by screen-sharing your Google Chrome window to the TV. 

Key benefits over competitors:
- Price
- Ability to cast internet browser window directly to screen (any website can be on your TV screen with this product)"
4817	lpradokenna	5	Great product!	Bought this so I could turn my TV into a smart one and I couldn't be happier!
4818	jd24	5	Works great	I have the old first gen Chromecast and I leave it at my parents home for them. I recently brought a Mini Projector and wanted to free it from cords. This works better than the first gen and looks alot sleeker too.
4819	Jack	5	Great!	Fast and easy to set up. Works great. Love it. Much cheaper than buying cable or satellite.
4820	dkeathley77	5	What I expected	It does exactly what I wanted without any issues and it has a good price.
4821	DonAta	5	Great device	"I have a Smart TV that it is not very ""smart"". Thanks to this gadget I am able to watch Netflix, You tube, etc., with an amazing easy instalation and video quality"
4822	Nik1028	5	Heads solo 3	Went in and bought an open box beats solo 3. I got a great deal and the woman was very helpful. Tested to make sure it works before I left. I'm very happy with this purchase and hazlet Best Buy location. I recommend this store highly to others. Beats work fantastic and I use them everyday.
4823	Gabby	5	Great for streaming movies	I bought as a gift for my husband for his birthday. We are really happy with it!
4824	CALinPA	4	Good Product If you have a strong WiFi signal	Overall, this works as advertised. It may seem obvious, but you do need a strong WiFi signal for this to work properly. The rating of 4 stars is due to the fact that it runs very warm (sometimes even hot). That seems to be normal according to other reviews I've read. to provide consistent operation, we found it best to disconnect from your device after each use.
4825	jakobida2314	5	excellent	I now have two in my house. Perfect for when the cable fails.
4826	chefsmoke1	4	this is very cool	this is a very cool product is my 2nd one will def buy more
4827	Boomer	5	Great Product	Once you set it up (by using the Google Home app on your phone or tablet) or using a Chrome browser on any computer, you can then stream anything your browser can play using the Cast button. Easy to use and inexpensive!
4828	NBUtah	5	Fun	Chromecast is fun and easy to use. Linked to my Google home, can control Netflix.
4829	Jhony	3	Good	"It does not have the ""mirror"" option for Mac devices like iphones, ipads etc."
4830	Yogi	5	Nice!	Setup was so easy and seamless and it works like a charm. Precisely what I expected :)
4831	Anarch	4	Perfect for projecting phone screen	Great product, easy to use, made entertaining guest easier
4832	SAPPHIRE	5	Great purchase	Simple to setup and operate. The only limitation is your WiFi connection.
4833	Dave	5	Works as advertised	"I found that most of my favorite programs are available on line but needed a device to ""cast"" from my iphone to the TV. A quick bit of research led me to Chromecast. Works very well and I am pleased with it."
4834	DaveMS44	3	Works	I mean it works for what I needed, Apple TV is way nicer (I have an iPhone and MacBook Pro)
4835	DanW	4	many functions	all you need is to have chrome installed and you are good to start streaming from any device to chromecast.
4836	Cipher3113	5	Love my Chromecasts!	Most of our entertainment is streamed, so Chromecasts have become a staple in our home. They're solid performers and allow us to watch nearly anything we live on command through our trusty phones.
4837	Donna	5	Chromcast	Great for college apt to be able to watch shows without having cable.
4838	NewJLB	3	Only casts, doesn't stream	"This allows you to ""cast"" onto your tv from a smart device. It does NOT have any programs/apps loaded on it. I prefer Apple TV, or just get a Roku TV so you don't have an extra remote."
4839	andrepillon	5	Great product	The Google Chromecast is a great enterteinment suplly.
4840	iPanguru	5	It works	Does what I needed it too do. Smooth streaming with no issues.
4841	DDdetroit	5	Best purchase for my IPad	If you have an old TV laying around, you can use it to watch Netflix (if you have a subscription) and control everything with your IPad. Also, you can download apps from TV stations. I wasn't able to get live streaming. Watch YouTube or Ted. But, your cable company will block certain things. Best thing ever to get around another cable box. Very, very easy to set up and use.
4842	Dave	5	5ghz connection is a must!	I bought this to stream over my 5ghz connection. This seems to be a more stable setup than the first gen.
4843	Mike84	5	Faster than the previous model	Faster than the previous model. I like it! Happy to have the updated model
4844	NICK	4	Nothing to complain about	I bought this to use once in a while and it seems to work well. No complaints from me.
4845	Chris	5	Great	The greatest innovation computer engineers have made is all I can say
4846	Ngboi	5	Chromecast works great!	The Chromecast works great. Easily plugs into HDMI slot and can either plug into USB slot or power source. Would recommend
4847	donb	3	good	good product would reccomend to a friend works well
4848	chromecat	5	Chromecast	Love it for the family area! Use it for all my entertainment needs!
4849	Lynn	5	Exactly what i needed	Great streaming device for Netflix, hulu, and hbo2go
4850	leon	4	Amazing	It is a wonderful device for casting all my phones work with it
4851	Ralphy	5	Better than I imagined all	All this entertainment for so little money,WOW !!!!
4852	jllaudio	5	Easy Set up	No streaming hangups works very well. The ability to cast to TV from tablets a plus.
4853	bmsievers	5	Love the Chromecast	I have used Chromecast for a few years now. I needed to buy another one, now all of my TVs have streaming capabilities. I swear by steaming now!
4854	bostonnomore	5	Great way to stream	I love how easy it is to setup and the ability to cast my video apps like hulu and netflix from my phone to my tv. I also like that i can set it up to show my photos as the screensaver.
4855	Shanda	4	streams well most of the time	Streams pretty well most of the time. Sometimes has a small delay, which could be a network issue. I always seem to have to reboot my router before I use it though. I don't know if that's just me.
4856	Andrew	5	No Fuss	Set up was easy, and does what we want it to do. Works with both my wife and I's Google Pixels, as well as other devices.
4857	Averagejoe	4	Does what it’s supposed to	Easy to set up. Thought it had an interface but it’s a hub to stream from devices. Works for what I need. I stream PlayStation VUE to a tv with it.
4858	Superconsumer	4	Good cheap tech	I bought this to use with my google home and works like a charm. Nothing feels more futuristic when you walk in the house and say ok google watch YouTube and YouTube starts to play. I got this on sale for $25 and it does the job it was designed to do. No more no less.
4859	ThorzDaddy	5	Great	This is my third chrome cast, love them, easy to use and works perfect every time.
4860	eb30	4	Good option if it fullfil your needs	This is a good product. Do what it suppose to do. It has some limitations. It is all about what you really need.
4861	tcole	4	Works good	Works good just makes old tv smart. Cheaper than a new tv
4862	jdwking	5	Amazing product!	I am very impressed with this little device. This was exactly what I needed to get going. Works as advertised and is great product.
4863	dswheeler	5	Streams flawlessly from devices.	Many devices can stream from the standard providers, NetFlix, etc., but my family uses it mainly to stream directly from our devices. It works flawlessly and is easy to set up. Strong recommendation.
4864	Mech	2	Not great	I tried this device for streaming video to my tv. The Video quality was awful and choppy.
4865	BananaKins	5	Faster version of the original	Very nice, works great and doesn't overheat like the first generation. My go-to streaming dongle.
4866	Lucky	5	My Favorite Streaming Device	Easy to use! I use 3 at home and 4 at the office. I like that the Chromecast is not tied to a single account and that anyone with a smartphone, tablet or computer on the wifi network can use it.
4867	David	4	Affordable ways to stream HD content to a dumb TV	Chromecast is an affordable to stream HD content to a dumb TV via an Andriod device or an iPhone. This Chromecast is only capable to stream HD content, if you want 4K, you will need to look for the 4K capable version of Chromecast. I knocked off 1 star because you cannot mirror screen from an iPhone. Screen mirror is only supported on Andriod device.
4868	Dannan	5	Google Chromecast	As same as my previously purchased Chromecast unit, the set up was simple and quick.
4869	Traveler	5	Easy to use	This has helped me cut the cable and let me search the web for streaming TV, movies, stream my pictures from my phone. I bought a second for my other TV
4870	Wiliam	5	Excellent product!	Excellent product that makes its work. I turned my old tv into a smart tv.
4871	Patrick	5	Awesome device	The chromecast is a smooth way to cast any device to your TV. Highly recommend
4872	Hal2D2	5	Easy to Use	Have a couple. Each one gets easier to setup and use.
4873	tsamilu	4	It works just like it's supposed to	It works just like it is supposed to. I'm not sure if it's hooked up right because I have to use screen mirroring to watch some things.
4874	Deee	5	Works great with Google Home	I purchased this device so that I could watch YouTube videos using Google Home. This thing works seamlessly with Google home and effortlessly with my other chromecast capable devices
4875	Harry	5	Good Product	Wonderful and Good Chrome cast as always from Google
4876	Lump	5	Great for newcomers to streaming	I purchased this for my nieces and nephew at Christmas with tv's I purchased at a great sale price. My niece showed me how it worked and it was actually simple and I have used it since works great for me as a starter streaming device
4877	Ibrahim	5	Great product	Best Buy provide very good product and best prices, I'm very satisfied with my nem purchase
4878	Sam8653	5	Cool Device	I like this casting device easy to install and ready always when I need it
4879	kindmike91	2	Don't like it	I was highly disappointed. It was not easy to use and I have difficulties getting it to work properly.
4880	safarrell62	5	So fun-I just had to share	I received a Google chromecast as a gift from my boyfriend. I didn't get it at first, but now I LOVE IT!!! My sister was so impressed when I was sharing some youtube videos on my television, that she wanted one too. It worth it!
4881	Liz22	5	Amazing product	Works great for phones and computers! Use it frequently
4882	Tony	5	Great	Didn't know that this product existed till I went to Best Buy for the information
4883	Dschwartz32	5	Classic Google	No issues. Great product. This is my third or fourth and they're all worthwhile purchases.
4884	Mak01	2	HOT!!	It immediately got very hot. Some Googling revealed that this sometimes happens when it is underpowered by the TVs USB port, but I had it plugged in using the AC adaptor. I returned it.
4885	Rainman	5	Great capability with no (little) effort	Plugged it in, input wifi credentials, and immediately had a versital input device
4886	Rascissi	5	Good device	Good device for connecting to tv and other devices
4887	Nanette	5	Chromecast	To me was a little bit confusing to install on to my TV set. I just watched on utube on how to install on Chromecast. However I do recommend the Chromecast for cell/laptop/tablets screen to tv site. Chromecast does not have extra channels that you can add like roku does.
4888	Tanya	4	Good deal	Good price for what it does went back and brought one for the kids
4889	Shay	5	Awesome Product	This product works very well. I have purchased a total of five of them and I've never had a problem with any of them. I listen to Pandora, watch movies on Netflix, and cast from YouTube while using this product. I would definitely buy another one and highly recommend it to others!
4890	Jerry	5	cool product	Lets me stream anything to my TV from my phone, tablet or laptop. I don't have a smart TV so this is the perfect product.
4891	GreatChrome	5	Great Addition To Our Current System	"We already have a large screen TV in addition to a large family.
When we gather together, we often try to share pictures,video's and UTube's this makes it possible and really easy.
We really like the product"
4892	Venkat	4	Chromecast	This is working great and the price is very reasonable. This is very well worth to have..
4893	Telgo	5	Chromecast	It's exactly what I was looking for. I gave my old one to my son and replaced with the latest version.
4894	Pablolino	5	Excellent product	I love chromecast love the second generation not worth buying third generation it is the same thing
4895	Veena	5	Love it	Google chromecast is worth the money spent .. easy to plug in and u are all set to go
4896	Anonymous	5	Chromecast	Excellent device. Casting videos to my TV could not be any easier.
4897	Joljim	5	So easy to use and useful	Easy to install and easy to use. Best Buy has the best price too
4898	ash007	5	Great next gen chromecast	Chromecast works flawlessly. This new version supports both 2.4g and 5g WiFi bands. Faster than the original version. Highly recommend thi's for any tv. Generally this works faster than the built in tv apps.
4899	mlewis	4	Chromecast works	I'm technically challenged, but figured it out with the help of Google! A life saver!
4900	Redz	4	Awesome buy	"Easy and quick. Definitely serve it's purpose. Would recommend it
."
4901	Carlosacruz	4	Does the job	It is not the best reception gadget but at least does what I want..
4902	Mike	5	Exelent	Easy to use ,just plug and play.exelent resolution.
4903	MattyB	5	Great for Office	Works great for screen casting and office use!!!!!
4904	nally	4	good product	this product lets me review my pictures and play music with ease on my TV
4905	Ashley45050	5	No more fighting	This chrome cast is easy to use, and has settled ourvhikdrens arguing over who gets to watch Netflix on the tv in our house-we have it on more tv's now
4906	electronicsguy2015	5	Great Product	Since I got this product I no longer needed cable which has saved me a lot of money. I love this device.
4907	Shopjack	5	WORKS GREAT	"So much better than all the wires and has super reception and
transmission.. One of your salesmen told me about the Chromecast unit
and solved my dilemma."
4908	MichaelJackson	5	Chromecast	Love it to death if that was possible. Much, much better than the 1st generation. I'd recommend this to anybody.
4909	Tiff	5	Great tv watching	Works well with Google home. Makes tv watching experiences more enjoyable and hands free.
4910	Jen95	5	Love this easy to use	Quick set up and easy to use bought one for myself then one for my mom
4911	Wendy	5	Great for Game of Thrones	We cast Game of Thrones from our HBO now account and works perfectly!
4912	Boone	5	Easy to use	I actually walk in an heard about the product an decided to buy it. Great decision.
4913	Instructormoore	5	Awesome	Finally switched from Fios to Comcast and have a stable internet connection to use my Chromecast.
4914	Amshres	5	Good product	Good product. Easy to use. Even my old dad can use it. Customer service for BB EXCELENT.
4915	Srini	5	Excellent Product!!!	Ease of use and just a 3 step process of step..it's allmost kind of plugin play
4916	Pete	4	Easy set up	Used chromecast tect. for set up was very helpful.
4917	Ashish	5	Recommended product	Recommended product. Works just fine. I had one. This is my second one.
4918	Theloveofthemoon	5	Awesome	You do not pay for cable if you have this!! You can stream anything to it.
4919	Feadog003	3	It's just ok	Not a big fan. I am not part of the google ecosystem, so there is a bit of a learning curve. The Fire tv stick seems to fit my needs much better.
4920	VR4K	5	Excellent quality for price	Great little device, easy to hook up, great way to display videos and pictures on big screen instead of phones and high quality HD.
4921	dathenah	3	Okay for the most part	I bought this as an experiment to see whether I would stick with this for streaming or get a Roku player. I think am going to get a Roku player instead for stuff like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now. It's nice to have for streaming unconventional media such as video off Facebook or even Microsoft OneDrive and I like streaming Spotify on it. To watch Netflix or Hulu on it however, using my phone as a remote just isn't jiving with me.
4922	CG08	5	Works great	I love it. I use it for my bedroom and it works beautifully.
4923	SeanF	5	Big Improvement	Definitely less problems setting up this Chromecast versus the old model. Better signal reception as well.
4924	Mick	4	Casting	This is a great device to transfer videos, pictures, etc from your smart device to a television set. Therefore, you can see pics, vids, etc on the big screen. 4 stars because some videos come in fuzzy. Not as clear as the smart device is playing it.
4925	Ciberzilla	5	Very easy	Works well, easy to install. No issues. Great price
4926	chicago312	5	Works with youtube paid tv	Works with youtube paid tv. cheaper than apple tv but does less.
4927	Sudi	5	Handy	Great tool when traveling and the AirBnb you're staying at does not have cable.
4928	andregoras	4	Great product	"I use it in my home, and it works perfectly. Broadcast television is great, but streaming is the future, and Google's Chromecast is one of the easiest ways of getting video streams onto your existing non-smart TV.

The puck plugs into an HDMI port on the rear of your TV, is powered by micro-USB, and is controlled by your existing smart device.

Simply open up a compatible app, and tap the 'Cast' button to immediately see content streamed to the big screen."
4929	mick	5	great device	The most seamless streaming experience I have and huge improvement over the original chromecast device. Well done Google!
4930	Oscar	5	Awesome able to view mostly	It is a very nice product I have 3 at home and now I gave one to my brother
4931	slickakira	5	Quick and easy	The new chromecast (i had the older version) is a lot faster and very easy to setup. It does everything that it states to do so no need to be redundant. Just make sure you know you have to have a power source either on your TV (USB) or by an outlet. It's a little misleading when you look at the picture
4932	phone123	5	cut cable	No longer needed cable with this device.I will be able to watch nil.
4933	Tfran1521	5	Great	This is my 3rd Chromecast, it's great to have on TV's around the house so you can cast your stuff on the big screen.
4934	Wolfe	5	Cast Anywhere	I love the chromecast. I had the original model and upgraded to this one. This one is great has lots of functions. I can hit it from anywhere in my apartment.
4935	Hari	5	Excellent	Google Chromecast: Enjoy a world of entertainment with Google Chromecast. Just connect to your HDTV's HDMI interface and your home Wi-Fi network to get started. You can stream your favorite apps from...
4936	webgirl	5	Chromecast is worth getting!	I got this for my uncle who wanted to stream youtube videos without getting an internet-capable tv! Installation was quick and easy!
4937	Awen	4	Much better than 1st gen but still needs work	"I have used a chromecast for nearly three years now and this one is much better in form and function than its predecessor. The cable is much more flexible which works well with my Xbox since the Xbox is crammed in a tight space. I like the options to change what kinds of pictures it displays when it isn't being used as well including albums from Facebook. However, the photos are often poorly cropped so one section of the picture is zoomed in making the Fb picture function more annoying than useful.

It's getting better but doesn't deserve 5 stars quite yet."
4938	Maxdog	5	Good Value	Use daily to stream Hulu and Netflix to tv as have parted ways with cable company. Works beautifully and reasonably priced.
4939	DIYdad	5	Powerful Puck	Works great, even with my old flat screen (non-smart) tv. I simply connect my iPad to the cromecast wi-fi and and cast all my movies to my tv. This cromecast puck was even cheaper than buying an HDMI cord from TV to my iPad, to do the same thing. This has even more options than currently using. Great find.
4940	TVstreamer	4	Great way to stream content from compatible device	Before anyone slams the Chromecast, you must be aware that it's a streaming receiver, lacking a user interface. That means that your compatible devices must be able to cast content to the Chromecast device. It serves its purpose, but should you be casting content from a PC, that it needs to be really fast. It's somewhat watchable, albeit a bit of lag, using a computer with a Core 2 Duo processor. Occasionally the Chromecast receiver crashes and automatically reboots, so there may be a delay in receiving a signal, which necessitates the user to re-cast the content to the Chromecast. Otherwise it's good, and allows the family to view content.
4941	FearlessGodlyWoman	5	Love it	It's so easy to install and yet best to use for my kiddos
4942	Fpator	5	Fun product	Very useful, I don't have a smart tv, and I bought the chrome cast.
4943	Salem	5	Great product!	Got this for my parents, they enjoy it very much. I would definitely get them another one; it is made well, good quality feel btw.
4944	riahb14	5	Exactly what I wanted	Cast from my phone or laptop. Music or video. Love it. The screensaver is fun too.
4945	kellymartinusa	5	Easy to setup, easy to use	I have a Samsung TV and can cast my phone to it, but this just makes using Netflix and YouTube so much easier! Great product!
4946	carlowho	5	Slightly faster than the original	It's a must have for any TV. It makes casting very convenient. I have the first generation chromecast and I can see that there's is a slight improvement in speed. I use it primarily for youtube but hulu, netflix, and other apps are also available.
4947	Fred	5	Works like it said it would	Easy to connect and set up. Instructions were clear and it works great.
4948	Bigboy	4	Very practical	Works without a glitch. Great to cast laptops to TV. Only issue is it's not compatible with Apple products.
4949	MarkMe2525	4	Easy to operate	Straight to the point and easy to use. I only wish it had a little more power in the networking department as I have to reset device often to get it connected to the internet.
4950	erikalo	5	Works perfectly	It is a good gadget to convert a regular TV into a smart tv
4951	prasanth	4	Good one	Using this for last two months. It serves the purpose.
4952	AParker	5	A great home streaming option	Setup was easy, just connect the device to the TV's HDMI and to power (either wall or your TV's USB hook up) and follow the on screen instructions to connect the Chromecast to your home wifi network. Current generation Chromecast is infinitesimally better designed, it hangs up less when attempting to connect it to any potential streams and has a better buffering quality than my hard connection desktop. Additionally, it played through an entire Netflix show even after we lost internet. Would highly recommend.
4953	Roy2020	5	Great Product	I was able to save a lot of money by purchasing this and canceling my cable . It is a must have !!!!
4954	Tuck	5	Great item to use.	Chromecast is awesome for everything you need it for and everything you can use it for.
4955	Halon45	5	Works great!	works flawlessly and game of thrones comes in without interruptions
4956	Sebastian	4	Great little piece of technology	I love my chromecast. I used to love the OS on my smart TV but after using the chromecast I find it more convenient to control everything from my smartphone as opposed to a remote control. The only down side is that Amazon does not allow you to cast any of their services to your chomecast.
4957	Electroniclover	5	Great for traveling	Love this product! We take this for traveling all the time. We can have a movie night while away from home in cabins. We hook up chromcast with our computer to the TV in the cabin. Works well.
4958	AndroidPD	5	Expectations met	For those who resist to buy a smart TV, this is the best option. Minimalistic and small device that can be hidden behind the TV.
4959	Jennifer	5	Keep it simple	I now own 3 Chromecasts. Keep it simple stupid has always been my motto. Chromecast does just that.
4960	Kaizen61	5	Best options for streaming media	The nice thing about Chromecasts is that so many platforms and devices support it.
4961	lynn	4	great little device	wish the directions were more concise to make it easier to install and use.
4962	rob2014	5	Great product	I love this product. It is cheaper and so much more convient then cable.
4963	Kathi	4	Enabled me to watch HBO now on tvgood buy	Pleased and amazed at all the apps on the Chromecast
4964	nytebyrd13	5	Perfect streaming device	I love my chromecast, goes perfect with my Google Nexus tablet and phone. Streams great, easy setup, and perfect for viewing photos and videos from my phone onto my TV
4965	rjsc	5	Good product	It seems to be working well and doing what it is supposed to do.
4966	Jjhess	4	My 2nd one	Works with mostly everything and I highly recommend it
4967	Danman	5	Chromecast	Purchased NEW Chromecast and installation was easy.
4968	Matt	5	Love it	The product works well and I enjoy using it. No 4K but that's ok.
4969	Wirelesscharger	5	Chromecast	Very good product and worth putting money in this product
4970	Angelsobe	5	Great way to entertaining	Love chromecast and Best Buy on south beach Florida. Thanks Pedro you the best.
4971	FearNoFish	5	Chromecast	Works great - love it and can watch almost everything on it except amazon prime. But I love it
4972	Steve	5	Good for use	It is very convenient device for your tv. I love it a lot.
4973	Sirv	5	Highly recommended	I was looking for a cable to attach my Note 5 to my TV. An associate from Best Buy told me that the Google Chromecast is an alternative because my Note 5 does not have any cable that support connection to my TV that is not a Smart TV. Now I see in a big screen Neflix, you tube, fotos, videos, etc and even more we have kareoke nights. Great product for a good price.
4974	Ashley	5	Love it	I've had the old version and bought a couple of these new ones. I prefer this new version because it is less likely to break at the point where the cord goes into the Chromecast because it has a flexible cord. Highly recommend.
4975	Walt1227	5	Great divice for older non smart tv's	Easy to set up, very usefull, you can use all your streaming apps like netflix and youtube on the bigscreen. Very convenient to have
4976	Lloyd	4	Smart Device Liberator	"Thanks to this device all the media on my device is free!!! Casting media to 65"" T.V. from my tiny phone is a great plus. One star off due to needing WiFi to use it which makes it barely usable to unusable when at hotels. I use ScreenBeam Mini 2 when I'm in hotels."
4977	nzbuchanan	4	Great Idea	The Chromecast is a great product as long as you don't need to use the device you're casting from while watching something. It's great for watching things from your computer on your tv, but then you can't use your computer for other things at the same time. That's the only negative about it.
4978	Aurora	5	Great price	I think I was a good price for both items usually the chrome cast is over 35 dlls
4979	Ambi	5	I liked it	My friend suggested that I can play vedio from my mobile.
4980	dakjr	4	good addition to have	Nice to watch games on TV through i phone. Second one I have in my house. works well but I will have to up grade my wifi in order to bust my reception. Right now the reception is spotty at times.
4981	ProfessorX	5	I couldn't resist.	At $25 I had to get one. And it worked. It does what it says it will. Take it anywhere. If you have hdmi and wifi, you can watch you shows, movies, etc.
4982	dena47	5	Handy way to use TV as laptop monitor	"Chromecast allows my 55"" TV to be used as a wireless monitor for my laptop running Chrome. The ""tab"" option is nice because the image sent to the TV continues to be from a given tab while I can use other tabs on the laptop to look up info, etc. Both my laptop running Windows 10 and my Smart TV have a mirrorcast feature but it is unstable and I don't use it much. Chromecast seems to be much more stable during the short time I have used it. Chromecast was a little tricky to set up, but I am still giving 5 stars because I'm not sure whether that setup problem had to do with my system and it works well once it is set up."
4983	9999	4	Easy To set Up	Easy to Set up and casts efficiently. A little more difficult to change settings or naming once initially set up.
4984	SL66	5	Great solution for casting	This is my second chromecast. It makes it so easy to cast multi-media using chrome browser to my TV and a projector. I am loving it.
4985	Cindy	5	Easy easy setup!	From opening the package to casting from my IPad, 30 minutes, tops!
4986	Bloque	5	Great gift for my home !!!	An economical way to turn your tv into a smart tv !!!
